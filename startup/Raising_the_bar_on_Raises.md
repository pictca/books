# Raising the bar on Raises
If you've ever asked for a raise, you know that it can be really
intimidating and it seems like each time you do it, it's unfamiliar
territory.

But as the person in change, you have to continue to consider many
factors beyond the person who's asking for a raise and ultimately create
a consistent process that your employees can feel confident about.

## The Scenario
An excellent employee asks you for a raise.

 - CEO's Perspective
    You want to keep this person around because she's done great work.
    You want to give her what she's asking for to make her happy and, of
    course, to gain some cool points.

 - Employee's Perspective
    Horowits said. "This is something they've thought about a lot.
    They've compared their other options. They may have an offer from
    another company ... It's a serious thing."
 
 - Company Culture
    So, as great as the employee asking for a raise is, what about all
    of your other employees?

    Horowitz said that if you give the person a raise who's asking for
    it, other people in your team may be wondering, "Okey, so I didn't
    ask for a raise and I didn't get a raise. They asked for a raise
    and they got a raise. What does that mean?"

    This may lead people to belive that you aren't really evaluating
    performance, but instead are just rewarding a one-time initiative.

    Other employees may not be "that person" who asks for a raise, but
    instead are people who expect to work for companies who notice and
    reward their efforts as is. This will undoubtedly lead to some team
    turbulence.

    "The culture conclusion is that everybody in your company is going
    to feel that they now have a fiduciary responsibility to their
    family to ask for a raise all the time because if they don't, they
    may be missing out on a raise that they would have otherwise
    gotten."

    This will lead to a bunch of people asking for raises all the time -
    something Horowitz said is called "encouraging behavior."

## Horowitz Solution
"You have to be formal to save your own culture," and this doesn't just
apply to more established startups.

Even if you have beanbag chair, weekly happy hours, and a Pac Man
machine in the lobby, regulating the raise process and making it clear
to your entire team will make you and team more accountable for
performance.

Horowitz said that with his proposed process, after someone has come to
you with a request for a raise, you should then evaluate her work for
one quarter or six months. At the end of your evaluation, you tell her
what her raise is -- simple as that.

After that, there is no further discussion as you've heard her input as
well as the input of the team during the evaluation. This is the best
way to make the process fair and consistent.

"It means you're understanding what everyone thinks and how this is
going to impact them and the culture of your company," said Horowitz.
