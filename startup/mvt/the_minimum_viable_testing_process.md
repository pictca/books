# The Minimum Viable Testing Process for Evaluating Startup ideas.

We started by testing specific "hypotheses" that we had about market. We
evaluated the veracity of those hypotheses individually using Minimum
Viable Tests. Collectively, these tests allowed us to predict whetever a
market was going to appreciate our product before we even launched an
MVP.

There are a lot of definitions of MVPs out there, but I'll suggest one:
An MVP is a basic early version of a product that looks and feels like a
simplified version of the eventual vision. An MVT, on the other hand,
doesn't attempt to look like the eventual product. It's rather a
specific test of an assumption that must be true for the business to
succeed.
 - In an MVP, you try to simulate the entire car. In an MVT, you are
 just testing whether the drivetrain is more powerful with an electric
 engine or a gas one.

The MVT process has major impact on how you build a company. MVP
methodology says you build an MVP, see how it goes an slowly iterate
upon it until it hits product/ market fit. Instead, I believes you can
more efficiently run a number of MVTs, create a vision for a product
that fits a market and then go into a "build phase."


In the MVP strategy, you have no strategy: You throw things at a wall
until it sticks. In the MVT world, you take time to discover a strategy
but once you have one, you move forward with conviction. By moving
forward with conviction, you more appropriately match the realities of
startups: It takes two to four years to know if you're right.

Below, I'll discuss why traditional MVPs can lead founders astray,
outline my 3-step framework for developing a Minimum Viable Tests, and
share examples from my career. I hope you'll find this useful, whether
you have a startup idea right now or a dream of starting a company
someday.

## The case against the Minimum Viable Product.
I like the idea of a Minimum Viable Tests because something about the
MVP concept leads people to over-build. As an investor or advisor to
over 30 companies and someone who has taught a course on how to generate
and evaluate startup ideas. I've seen founders make dozens of mistakes
during the pre-product/ market fit phase. Here are a few examples.

 - First, their vision is bigger than their insight.
    Product creators like to think of what's possible: They dream about
    how introducing their product into the market might change the
    world. This is an appropriate framing - as long as it comes with a
    bit of humble pie. New products don't succeed because of the wide
    breadth of features they provide. Facebook isn't successful because
    it allows people to build groups, host events or post photo of their
    dogs. Instead, Facebook is successful because of one core insight:
    People want to connect with their friends and family online. You
    can't have 20 insights and be successful- you must have just "one".

 - If you build an MVP, you start to think about the 20 features you
 might build to make people happy in a market, which takes your eye off
 the one specific insight that the customer actually cares about. Purity
 breeds success.

 - Second, founders over-focus on what the customer says - Customers
 don't know what the product should be. It's doesn't matter who they
 are; this is reality. People (include me) don't see themselves clearly
 - and therefore are blind to what they actually want and how they
 actually make decisions. The entire field of behavioral economics has
 been created because of how predictably irrational consumers are.
 Furthermore, they don't concern themselves with the future of your
 industry. They'll alway say they want a "faster horse," when in reality
 they may actually want a car. So if you rely on your customers to tell
 you what to build, you  will invariably build incremental improvements
 instead of delivering a novel breakthrough.

 - Third, founder get caught up in company-building before nailing
 product/ market fit.
    Building is secondary to delivering value. It's amazing to me how
    many people print company swag, come up with a name, hire a team,
    raise capital or design a logo before they know how they are going 
    to deliver value and to whom. Except for when practically required,
    you should avoid attaching yourself and your identity to title such
    as CXO, "founder" or anything. (Sometimes for the sake of
    fundraising or hiring, I'll use the CEO or co-founder title, but
    only for that purpose. I won't introduct myself that way in social
    setting or allow it to infiltrate my personal identity until after
    the company starts to accomplish something.)

    - I have a rule: no company swag until the business has at least
    $250K of revenue or 250K users. Until then, you don't get to feel
    the benefits of having started a company. You are nothing until you
    have customers who want your product.

 - Fourth, the word "product" in MVP implies an experience that has a
 distinct form.
    You've created the user journey you want your customer to go
    through, and you've narrowed that down to the smallest possible
    thing you can launch with. In many cases, this smallest possible
    thing isn't small. It could entail a login system, a tech stack, a
    database and sometimes even an admin dashboard. For the user, it
    involves an onboarding flow and a "customer experience." This leads
    to overbuilt MVPs and isn't really where you should start. You only
    want to build the login systems and onboarding flows after you've
    proven that you have something you can sell, aka after you have
    successed with minimum viable tests.

 - Finally, MVPs often make for horrible core products.
    When you start building a product, you start from a blank command
    screen. Once you start writing code, you start to add technical and
    product debt. So many startups I know end up spendign half of their
    engineering cycles paying back this debt in years 2-4. Instead, I
    suggest you run MVTs and then delete the code (better yet, don't use
    code at all!) This allows you to start from a fresh slate when you
    are actually building the longer-term vision.

    The point is to focus on product/ market fit in the pre-product/
    market fit phase and then move with conviction when you enter the
    building phase.

## Add Minimum Viable Tests to the Process of Creating a Startup:
If I look back on my previous companies, I've always started with the
same few step:
    - Immerse yourself in a new industry.
    - Use customer development to determine your user's job-to-be-done
    and how they currently accomplish those jobs.
    - Identify the promise you think you can make to help a user with
    thier jobs-to-be-done.

After this, many people start building an initial version of the
product(MVP) to try it out with some users. This is where I think the
mistake lies. Instead of building a full-on MVP, I propose going through
the MVT framework:

    - List the riskest assumptions that might lead your business to
    succeed or fail.
    - Test your assumptions through Minimum Viable Tests.

Repeat these steps until you have learned enough to de-risk your biggest
hypotheses. If you do this well and are intellectually honest, you will
likely come up with more than one risk. This will require you to run
multiple MVTs before you feel confident enough to move to an MVP.

Once you've finally tested enough hypotheses to have more confidence
about your product viability, then go to the next steps:

    - Build an initial product to bring all of your insights together
    and test them with your target customer.
    - Iterate on that product until you have nailed your product
    offering. AKA "Get to Product/ Market Fit"
    - Scale, baby, scale!

The rest of this article will drive into the MVT strategy, explaining
how and when to use it.

## What's a Minimum Viable Tests?
An MVT is a test of an essential hypothesis - something you must be
right about, or else the company won't stand a chance. For example, with
my current company Maven, it's essential that people find 10X more value
for cohort-based course than for a self-directed asynchronous course. 

Minimum Viable Testing involves identifying hypotheses you have about a
market and creating tests that only focus on those hypotheses, not the
long-term vision, the customer's opionions, company or product building.
This method forces you to be even more minimal in your initial tests, so
that you can save time and have higher accuracy on your eventual initial
product.

This philosophy works for technical founders, non-technical founders,
and even non-startup companies. Perhaps most attractive: It means you
can build a successful company without being technical. In fact, I've
almost always tested out my ideas before bringing on my technical
co-founder. This is valuable because technical team memvers are extrmely
had to attract, and it is far easier when you can say: "I have already
run tests and proven that these is demand for my product" instead of "I
have vision for something big." Engineers like data and proof, not
poe-in-the-sky vaporware.

    - If you focus on MVTs instead of MVPs, you get closer to the heart
    of the question: Can you predict success before you launch? I belive
    the answer is yes. With the right approach, you can make a strong
    prediction about your chance of success and reduce (not elimuinate)
    your chance of failure.

## The 3 step Minimum Viable Test Process
So, you've gone through step 1-3 above: You've immersed yourself in a
new industry and identified an opportunity. You've become best friends
with your target customers. You dream like them; you think like them.
You know their problems inside and out. Great. Now you're ideating on a
specific solution you think will work to help solve their problem. How
do you know if this opportunity is "the one"?

Simple: test it. That's what I'm talking about in step 4 and 5 above,
which is where my approach differs from what most people expect. The
following three steps are a more detailed explanation of how I think
about this part of the process:

## Find your value proposition.
Determine the promise of your idea. Why would users want it? What are
you promisign them?

 - Focus on action:
    This is often driven by customer development, but remember that
    customers do not always know nor are they forthcoming about their
    desires and needs. Their actions, however, speak volumes. Find a
    value proposition that speak to their actions: What are they already
    trying to do? How can you help them achieve their goals better than
    they know they can?
 - Stay away from ideas that are too complicated. Think about Stripe,
 AirBnb, Dropbox, Uber. They each had a ridiculously simply value
 proposition. Th solution might have been complex or controversial, but
 the value to the consumer was not. Who wouldn't want a taxi that arrive
 on demand in less than 5 minutes? Who wouldn't want one line of code to replace
 the days of implementing complex payment processing system? Find a
 value proposition that's a no-brainer.

## List your risky Assumptions
List the primary risks: why might this not work? What breaks your
system?

 - The #1 riskest assumption is building something people don't want.
    Everyone knows this; it is the Y Combinator motto. Yet somehow,
    about half of the founders I meet do not list "people want this" as
    a top-3 assumption they're making about their business
 - Execution risk is real.
    Lots of great ideas die because they simply don't work in reality. I
    remember hearing a pitch about cloud storage solution that was 1/10
    cheaper than Dropbox. If it worked, the company would've been a
    massive success. Unfortunately, it was vaporware. It's important to
    identify risks related to the feasibility of execution.
 - Marketing.
    So many founders have a great idea but can't figure out how to sell
    it. Second-time founders know that they shouldn't even bother with
    an idea if it is not sell-able. Marketing risks force you to face
    the truth: Do you know enough about your market to know how to sell
    it and who will buy it? Is there even a go-to-market strategy that
    can work or is that most difficult part of this business (and
    therefore the part I need to de-risk in my MVTs).

 - Market size.
    This is almost impossible to guess at and so many people hand wave
    their potential market size and put in fuzzy number. Low confidence
    is still better than no confidence. I strongly believe you should
    have a clear understanding of what you would want to see in order to
    believe there's a big enough market fro what you're doing. If your
    product is narrow and you believe it is extensible, then put that on
    your list of risks.

 - Profit.
    Almost all startups start with upside down profit margins. That's
    okay, but some companies will never get to positive margins. Giving
    something away at a third of the cost of delivery is a fast way to
    burn a lot of cash-and eventually shut down your company. Giving
    something away at 80-90% of the cost of delivery is more palatable.
    Force yourself to figure out what price consumers are willing to pay
    relative to the cost it is for you to deliver your solution.

## Test the atomic unit
Determine whether your idea actually works. Focus only on the "atomic
unit" of what you plan to sell. For Google, the atomic unit is a search
query. For Amazon, it's a ordering a book online. For Coinbase, it's an
easier way to buy and sell crypto.

 - Pick your risky assumption and test just one at a time.
    You will always get 2-3 risky assumptions tested in one go, but
    there should always be a primary. If there isn't, you won't get
    conclusive results.
 - Devise a test for that spectific assumption.
    If your riskest hypothesis is execution risk: test out execution by
    actually trying to deliver the goods or services in as hack-y a way
    as possible, Remember in those cases to evaluate the profit ratio.
    You'll learn what is going to be really tough and what is easier
    than you expected From there, you can often devise second and third
    tests to dive even deeper to specific areas of concern. If you
    riskiest hypothesis is whether people will want your product, do not
    ask them. Force them to pay for it with their time or their money.
    If they don't, then be honest with yourself about why and iterate
    until you find something people are absolutely in love with.
 - When devising a test, do not build out everything. Focus only on the
 hypothesis.
    In the case of Amazon, you don't need to build a web ordering
    system, a warehouse and a delivery system to evaluate whether people
    want eCommerce. Instead, identify your risky assumption: is it
    whether people actually want to buy books online? Then test just
    that by building a web page for book buyers. Your solution will help
    you learn whether your instincts are right. If you build a massive
    list of books, and the customer hate it - then you know that isn't
    the right solution. If instead you build a search form where they
    can search for a book and customers don't know what to put in, you
    know this is a discovery-based business rather than a search-based
    business. There are so many insights to be had that will provide
    nuance to any future product you end up building.

 - Pick a clear and specific atomic unit.
    The more niche the better in this case. You are looking for the
    smallest possible item that you could distill your product down to.
    This unit is important because consumers rarely ever buy the value
    proposition of a company, they buy a specific item that you are
    selling. Take Amazon. In 1994, nobody said, "Oh I wish there was a
    massive store on the Internet where I could go and buy anything I
    want." Business people might've had that idea, but no consumer did.
    Instead, consumers said, "I am interested in buying X book that I
    can't find in any bookstore. Where can I find it?" In this case, the
    consumer doesn't even care whether it's on the internet! So the
    atomic unit test for Amazon could even just be a phone service where
    you call and they help you find any book you may want.

## Examples in Action: How I've used Minimum Viable Tests As a Founder
Let's dive into some examples of how I've used the MVT process.

### Maven:
    - Value proposition: The promise of Maven is that a  platform for
    cohort-based courses would dramatically improve the quality of
    education on the internet.
    - Risky assumptions: People may not be willing to pay 10X more for a
    cohort-based course than for an asynchronous course.
    - Atomic unit test: The atomic unit is a cohort-based course. How
    can we test whether cohort-based course work as quickly as possible?
Wow, that's a big value proposition. How could you possibly test a
marketplace model, a technology product, and a new format for learning
all at once?

Instead of trying to test everything with MVP, I picked just one risk to
start. I could have picked so many others: Will people adopt a rev-share
business model for cohort-based course? Will consumers find it valuable
to have a centralized library of courses? As I wrote above, you test
should always have a primary risk. In this case, the primary risk is
profit question: on a per-seat basis, cohort-based courses are more
expensive to produce than video-based ones. So my first MVT was to
figure out the revenue-profit ratio of a course: Will consumers be
satisfied with buying a cohort-based course for a significantly higher
price point than video-based courses?

I'm not just looking for a binary answer here. Instead, I'm expecting a
nuanced result that would help influence future go-to-market decision.
For example, I may learn that a specific type of customer loves these
courses more than others. Or I might find out hat the value is in one
major part of the course (say, the community) instead of others (say,
the quality of the content). This is an art, not a science!

Remember that the goal of Maven is to build software for cohort-based
course creators. However, in this test, we chose not to focus on
software at all. The risk was about cohort-based courses and we decideed
to run a test that evaluates the course itself, not the software to run
the course. This is critical since it helped us dramatically reduce the
scope of our initial test.

### Solution: I decided to run just one course.
I picked a specific area that I knew well and then tried to run a course
on that subject. I found a partner who already had a big adjacent
business and asked him if he would co-teach a course with me. This
allowed me to test a course without having to build a marketing machine
from scratch. It was a hyper-narrow test that achieved the exact result
I was looking for: The course had a 9/10 rating from its student and
made over $150,000 in revenue in its first cohort.

I learned a ton, which shaped the future product. Building a community
is the hardest and highest leverage part (we failed at it in this cohort).
The price point was a no-brainer, and access to the instructor and the
energy in the room was a huge value-add. Student behavior was widely
variable across the student body.

Perhaps most importantly, I realized that there was a certain art to
community-building and course design that I personally did not have an
aptitude for. That's one of the major reasons I wanted to work with Wes
Kao, who is an expert here. I had many other potential candidates for
co-founder at Maven, but Wes had the unique capabilities that I lack. I
would never have known I lacked these capabilities if it weren't for the
test I ran.

## Spring:
 - Value proposition: The promise of Sprig was that a fast, healthy food
 delivery company would be lightyears better than existing food
 delivery.
 - Risky assumptions: The risk was that the operations of delivering food
 would quickly become a nightmare.
 - Atomic unit test: The atomic unit is a delivered meal. How can we
 test whether we can deliver meals to customers quickly without building
 a restaurant?

### Solution:
    Use a private chef. We found one on Craigslist, then emailed our
    friends saying we were going to open up special dinner service for
    one night. We asked them to order via Eventbrite and used a map on
    my living room table to do the dispatch. We recruited drivers via
    Settlers of Catan pieces that I placed on the map and moved around.
    Then, I used text messages to communicate the directions to the
    driver and send customer confirmations. Vaila - we started a
    restaurant in about 2 week.
    The goal of this test was to evaluate the operations. It was a
    success - we understand very quickly that it was both doable but
    also extremely complicated to run a delivery service like this. WE
    knew that the unit economics were tight but could likely work.
    Notice that this test did not evaluate many other potential
    hypotheses. We had no idea if consumers liked it (we were mostly
    focused on our friends after all). We didn't know how to market it.
    We also didn't worry about the ordering system, the potential
    delivery algorithms, and more. So many thing were left on the table. 
    The goal was just to prove one thing: that the operations of food
    delivery could be done via a distributed fleet of cars. We viewed it
    as a success: in one night, we delivered 40+ meals with just two
    weeks of preparation. But it doesn't end there.
 - For each MVT you run, you should ask yourself again: Now that I've
 proven or disproven that risk, what are other risks I should be
 considering and testing against?

 For Maven, we ran five different MVTs over nine months before we
 finally shipped v1 of our MVP. the MVTs tested things like: what would
 it be like to help someone else teach a course (instead of teaching one
 ourselves,) what is the value proposition to instructors to teach
 courses, and how do we build a community in a more concerted fashion.
 This enabled us to be incredibly confident that we were onto something.
 Within four months, we did $1 million in sales.

At Sprig, we ran three different MVTs over six months before we finally
launched our MVP. We knew what our offering was and had made dramatic
changes before we launched as a result of our MVTs. This helped us feel
confident that we could invest in things like a kitchen and a full-time
chef. Within six months, we did $1 million in sales.

## What Comes Next?
The MVTs provide knowledge about your market that help influence what
you do next. In some cases, the next step is to build an MVP and launch.
In others, it can be to focus on building out only one part of the
product and nail that. I'll use our two examples to show what I mean.

### Path 1: Nail what your customers care about most.
In the Maven example, the old MVP dogma would've said to build an
instructor facing product: a landing page builder, payment processing,
syllabus designer, etc. However, after running our MVTs we no longer
needed to assess whether instructors would use such a product. In fact,
we knew that they would earn them money! Surprisingly, most instructors
we pitched did not care about the product. They were mostly satisfied
with their current setup.

Instead, we learned that instructors cared about three things
 1. students loving their course
 2. attracting more students
 3. being in good company (social proof)

Since creators aren't product builders or engineers, they don't
think about or care about what software we might build; they care
how that software solves problems in their lives.

Now that we felt we were confident in the business, we didn't need
to go and build an instructor-facing MVP. Instead, we realized that
if we just got the right instructors on the platform and showed that
they could be successful, we could attract other instructors.

Our next step was to launch successful courses and unify them under
one platform so people could see what we were doing and want to be a
part of it. We still didn't have a name, website or instructor-side
onboarding. To attract our first instructor, we did launch the
basics of a course platform. Students could sign up, pay for the
course, and then had access to a student portal with links out to
the other products we used (Slack for community, Zoom for live video
call, Google Calendar for the invites).

Instead of shipping a full-fledged product, we focused on adding
more instructors onto platform - and six months later, we're now
working with 50+ instructors.
    
So far, we haven't shipped an instructor onboarding systems nor a
landing page builder. We're creating those things now and are gearing up
for a private and public beta of our product. In my view, this is far
more full-featured than any MVP. We skipped the MVP entirely and wen
from our MVT straight into company-building.

### Path 2: Ship the first version of your product
In the Sprig example, we took a more traditional approach. After running
our MVTs, we realized that it was necessary to give customer a basic
product for them to touch and feel. We needed to test their behavior and
see if our hunch that ordering food from Sprig could become a daily
habit was right. Also, building a restaurant is hard to do on a one-off
basic. Spinning up and shutting down production for our MVTs was a
serious cost and we needed to see what a fully-featured product would
look like.

So we geared up for a public launch, duct-taping together a first
version of the iOS app, building a very simple routing system and
shipping up a kitchen that was ready to do a hundred meal per day. The
rest is history - the company had incredible uptick and grew to a $6M
run-rate in its first year. Its early success was very much a result of
MVT process; we knew what customers wanted and delivered it.

## Using a Minimum Viable Tests to Say "No"
Some of you might be thinking: Have you ever tried an MVT and then not
moved forward? Loads of times. A specific example is a travel startup
idea I had. I was considering building a travel advice service where you
could connect with locals around the world and have them plan your trip
for you.
 - Value proposition: The promise was that consumers would want to
 connect with a travel advisor to help them plan trips based on local
 knowledge.
 - Risky assumption: The risk was operational. What would it look to
 match travel advisors with customers and how would we scale a business
 like this? I felt this was the hardest part: there are so many
 different countries and place that I wanted to see if there was a
 viable path to building liquidity in the marketplace.
 - Atomic unit test: The atomic unit was a planned trip. I decided I
 would test the operations by trying to find an advisor and plan a trip
 myself.

I was going to Southeast Asia and found a travel advisor based in
Thailand who seemed like an incredible fit. He planned the perfect
trip for me and my girlfriend. We honestly had a magical time.
Everything seems great, except one problem: He did not enjoy it. I saw
the job he had to deal with: the logistics and the pain of dealing with
us and it felt like there was a lot less leverage than I thought there
might be here. Every person is so different and unique, and travel
advisors are always going to have a bias toward certain types of
activities and people. I thought about the idea for months, and talked
to many other companies in the space.

Ultimately, I felt like this could be a strong business, but that
    A) I wouldn't enjoy it
    B) It would be much harder to match advisors than I expected and
    C) the advisor pool was extreme samll and relatively hard to find.
    Simply put, I couldn't find a path to success after the initial MVT
    and gave up on the idea.

Obviously, anyone could run the same test and see promise. There is no
perfect way to run this process; the goal is for you to see if you can
find a path. If you find a path, you keep going. If you feel like it
isn't your cup of tea, or you can't see the vision, that's okay. Someone
else might come around and invent a billion-dollar company, but it
wasn't meant to you. Without my co-founders Wes and Shreyans, I wouldn't
be the right person to start Maven.

 - It's common for people to start companies they aren't a good fit for,
 and it's painful to realize this after investing years of your life
 building it. In cases like those, an unsuccessful MVT can be a great
 thing.

## Closing Thoughts:
This process is art, not science. People often want to know exactly the
right answer to question like: When do I know I'm done with MVT process?
How do I know if my test is successful? This is where judgement comesin
and what separates the successful from the unsuccessful. It requires
intellectual honesty, rigorous thinking and some dumb luck.

### What's absolutely crazy about startups is that you can run all the
MVTs you want, build a great MVP, and still fail.
    I learned that with Sprig, which took off like a rocket ship only to
    peter out in year 4. One of the flaws of the MVT system is that you
    can't predict how a market will evolve as other competitors and
    companies enter the mix. In Sprig's case, we simply did not foresee
    how competitors we were going to be with the delivery applications
    like Doordash, Postmates and most importantly UberEats. In the
    beginning, we were out-delivery the competition and customer
    preferred us more than paying $10 for delivery and waiting one hour
    for their food. In the long run, however, as the network effects
    kicked in, these services got faster and cheaper. Eventually, they
    ate our lunch.

It is fact because startups are so risky that doing the MVT process make
sense. Once you have an MVT that's successful, it's important to avoid
"The Traction Treadmill." Zero out the revenue you made in the MVT. Use
the success to fundraise but don't use it for "Month over Month" growth.
Instead, start again from zero and focus on launching a product that has
product/ market fit. You can easily get trapped into a vicious cycle
where all you're doing a focusing on taking an initial MVT or MVP and
then trying to grow it Month over Month.

The whole point of the MVT strategy is to give you more confidence so
that you can forego short-term growth for long-term growth. Run a number
of MVTs create a product vision, and then execute on that vision while
getting feedback from your customers.

The goal of this framework is not to prevent failure. That's impossible.
The goal is to increase your chances of success. You'll still face long
odds, but if you run the above process well, you'll be able to tip the
scale more in your favor. Best of luck and happy testing.
