# Team Transparency

With your barrels identified, aim them at your goals and have them
tackle one thing at a time, rather than many.

This is a philosophy Rabios picked up from Peter Thiel (who is featured
in a later chapter about competition) while working at PayPal. He
explained.

"Most people will solve problems that they understand how to solve.
Roughly speaking, they will solve B+_ problems instead of A+ problems
are high impact problems for your company, but they are difficult."

To focus in on the A+ problems, Thiel would insist each person tackle
one single thing, and they don't move on from it until its complete. The
one-thing-at-a-time approach may not work with your business, but keep
in mind that the fewer tasks a person has to tackle, the more accountable
they are for one thing and the more attention they have to give to it.

Another way to eliminate distractions through transparency is to create
a shared, online dashboard of goals and metrics that people ideally look
to a daily basis.

"You have to create tools that enable people to make decision at the
same level you would make them yourself," said Rabois. 

This also means that everyone should have access to everything that's
going on elsewhere in the company.

Rabois said this can be done in very literal ways like having glass
walls around conference rooms and notes from all meetings available to
everyone at the company. This way, no one feels like they're being left
out of the loop.
