# Building Products
There comes a point where the brainstorming has to stop so the actual
creation can begin.

Here are the secret to building products - from consumer apps to
hardware to enterprise software - that customers will love.

## How to build products users love
### Kevin Hale

Do you know the secret to building products users love? It's time to
learn.

According to Kavin Hale, founder of Wufoo and partner at Y Combination,
making products users love involves focusing the bulk of your energy on
the customer.

"My philosophy behind a lot of things that I teach in startups is, the
best way to get to $1 billion is to focus on the values that help you
get the first dollar to acquire that first user. If you get that right,
everything else will take care of itself."

Wufoo is an online form-builder and when you visit the site, you can
already tell it's an outlier. Where most startups are constantly finding
new ways to be slick and sexy, Wufoo is unabashed in its goofy persona.

As Hale said, it looks like something Fisher Price made because it's so
easy to use. So easy that they have some of the world's largest
companies as their client.

Its simple, colorful appearance is not the only thing that separate
Wufoo from its competitors. During fundraising, they raised about
$118,000 total. But the return to their investors was about 29,561%.

To put that in perspective, the average startup raise about $25 million
and the average return to investors is about 676%.

Wufoo's ROI is something investors dream of but rarely attain. And much
of their success comes from their adamance for building relationship
with their customers.

The Wufoo team constantly ask themselves: "How do relationships work in
the real world and how can we apply them to the way we run our business
and build our product that way?"


## Seducing Your Customers
It's no secret that, in human relationships, first impressions matter
most. That's why when we go on a first date, we try on five outfits
before we pick just the right one and maybe even study up on some
talking points to sound interesting.

You need to make those initial interactions with your customers memorable - 
the first email, login, links, advertisements, and customer support.
Hale said that all of those moments are opportunities to seduce.

For example, when you go to Wufoo's login link, there's a dinosaur on
it. Hover on it, and the dinosaur will say "RaRRR."

Unless you're dead inside, this simple detail will put a smile on your
face. From then on, every time you login, you'll associate position
emotions with their product.

Seducing your customers doesn't have to involve some glossy campaign. As
long as you think about what emotions you elicit on your user's face,
you're heading in the right direction.


## Treat Customer Support Like a Marriage
Hale took many customer service lessons from marriage psychologist John
Gottman. Gottman is famous for being able to predict (with freakish
accuracy)  whether a couple is going to divorce. He just need to watch
them fight for 15 minutes.

### Anticipating Customers' Need
According to Gottman, in human relationships everybody fights about the
exact same things: money, kid, sex, time, etc. The same goes for
customer support complaints.
    - Money:
        This cost too much or I'm having trouble with credit cards
    - Kids:
        User's client
    - Sex:
        Performance (how long you're up and how fast)
    - Etc:
        competition and partnerships

Knowing these customer service triggers helps your anticipate what
complaints your users will bring to you, which in turn will make you
better equipped to solve their problems.

### Alway Response to Your Customers
Gottman also said that couples often break up because of four major
causes: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling.
Stonewalling is one of the worst things a person can do in a
relationship, yet startups do it often.

Stonewalling is when you have a lot of customer support call coming in
and you refuse to respond. Not meeting your customers' need is the
"biggest cause of churn in the early stages of startups," said Hale.

## Everyone on your team should do customer support
Another practice that separates Wufoo from a typical startups was the
integration of customer support into the role of software development.
They uphold values they feel aren't discussed enough, like
responsibility, accountability, humility, and modesty.
They call it SDD (Support Driven Development)

Jared Spool, a user interface engineer, largely informed these values.
He said that there's a direct correlation between how much time software
development spend directly exposed to users and the quality of their
designs.

So Wufoo spend 30% of their engineering time on internal tools to help
with customer support.

As a result, Hale said, their developers were "getting exposed to our
users for to eight hours every single week,"

"We redesigned our documentation over and over again, A/B tested it
constantly. One iteration of our documentation page reduced customer
support by 30% overnight," Hale said.

By concentrating on customer service, the product team actually had a
30% reduction of their workload.

## Emotions are Important
Wufoo prioritizes customer support because it's integral to every step
of the conversion process. If you fail at customer service, conversion
just don't happen. That's why frequent customer service experimentation
is a staple activity for the Wufoo team.

## The Little Experiment That Could
Not being face-to-face with the bulk of their users created an emotional
disconnect that hindered the customer support process.

The Wufoo team addresses this by adding a drop-down to their support
from that asked users about their current emotional state. Think of it
as the predecessor to Facebook's emotion status.

The team expected this experiment to fail. But not only was the support
field out 75.8% of the time, user also filled out the emotional state
drop-down 78.1% of the time. How the user felt about a problem was just
as important as the technical solutions the Wufoo team provided.

## The Secret to Getting Nicer Users
Working in customer support is extremely stressful. You're basically
getting paid to have people yell at you for eight hours every day.
Customer support worker often have the least amount of power to affect
change in an organization, but they receive the majority of the users'
frustrations.

Because Wufoo had their software team doing support work, users became
less frustrated. This was because they were interacting with people who
could actually do something about their problems. But, providing an
emotional outlet brought it to another level.

People started being nicer to the support team as a result. User became
more rational and in turn made the Wufoo team's job more pleasant.

## The Take-Away
Your customer interactions, whether through UI or customer service, are
all part of a larger relationship you're forming with them.

Take care to make their entire experience pleasant, and in return,
they'll see your company and product as something well worth their time
and money.
