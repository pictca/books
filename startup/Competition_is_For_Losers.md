# Competition is For Losers.
### - Peter Thiel
What does competition actually look like in the startup world? How can
young businesses be competitive? And is our society's relationship with
competition healthy?

## Creating Value
Comparing the size of the search industry, you would come to the
conclusion that airlines are more important than search. But Thiel points
out that the airline industry's profit margins are significantly less
than those of the search industry.

In the airline industry, the companies make money, go bankrupt, get
recapitalized, and that cycle repeats itself. This is reflected in the
combined market capitalization of the airline industry, which is close
to just a quarter of Google's. So even though the search industry is
much smaller than air travel, it's actually more valuable.

So how do you go about creating value when you first start business, and
what make a company valuable? Thiel said you have to create something of
value and capture some fraction of the value you've created.

## Monopolies vs Perfect Competition
Thiel sees the business world as a binary. On one end of the spectrum,
you have industries that are perfectly competitive, and at the other end
of the spectrum are monopolies. Thiel said, "There is shockingly little
that is in between."

## Monopolies
Monopolies are more stable, long-term business, and they have more
capital. And if you get a creative monopoly for inventing something new,
it often means you've created something really valuable 

The other side of things is perfect competition.

## Perfect Competition
Perfect competition is "a market structure in which the following five
criteria are met":
 - 1. All firms sell an identical product.
 - 2. All firms are price takers - they cannot control the market price
      of their product.
 - 3. All firms have complete information about the product sold and the
      prices charged by each firm.
 - 4. Buyers have complete information about the product being sold and
      the prices charged by each firm.
 - 5. The industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit.

### Pro
Perfect competition is always easy to model and it's efficient,
especially in a world where things are static.
### Con
Perfect competition doesn't make money when a lot of competition is
involved.

## The Lies We Tell
### Monopolies pretend to have lots of competition

According to Thiel, monopolies tend to lie. They don't want the
government to regulate them, so they won't call themselves a monopoly.
What do they to escape scrutiny? They pretend to have a lot of
competition.

For example, Google has a 66% market share of the search industry. But
you'll never hear them decribe themselves as a search engine anymore.
Sometimes they call themselves an advertising company and sometimes they
refer to themselves as a technology company.

There's a good reason for this renaming. The technology market is valued
at close to $1 trillion. So Google's narrative is that they're competing
with all the car companies with their self-driving cars, they're
competing with Apple on TVs and smartphones, they're competing with all
the car companie with their self-driving cars, they're competing with
Apple on TVs and smartphone, they're competing with Microsoft on office
products, and they're competing with Amazon on cloud services.

They've positioned themselves in the expansive technology market where
there's competition everywhere. That's how they escape the threat of
regulating their monopoly.

## Non-Monopolies Pretend to Have No Competition
The companies on the other end of the spectrum, which exist in a highly
competitive industry, are also tempted to lie because they may not make
any money otherwise.

They'll say they're doing something unique that is less competitive than
it looks. They want to seperate themselves from the rest of the herd and
attract capital. Theil said that they do this to increase their
perceived value.

For example, a new restaurant that no one wants to invest in (because
restaurants are notoriously bad investments) will be tempted to rebrand
themselves. They'll claim that they're the only Britih food restaurant
in Palo Alto. That's too small of a market. But because of the way they
talk about their place in the market, it seems like they have a monopoly
on British food in Palo Alto.

## The Result?
"In a world where monopolists pretend no to have monopolies and
non-monopolies pretend to have monopolies, it seems like the
different between the two is very small. But it reality, the real
difference is vast. These lies produce a distortion of the business
world."

Look at the big companies: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. They
have built up cash for years, producing incredibly high profit margins.

Thiel said that the U.S. tech industry has been so financially
successful because it's prone to creating monopoly-like businesses.
These companies accumulate so much cash that they don't even know what
to do with it beyond a certain point.

## Go After Small Market
If you're a  startup, you want to have a monopoly because monopolies
possess a large share of the market. But how do you get there?

Thiel advised beginning with a really small market, taking over said
market, and then expanding that market in concentric circles.

The biggest mistake you can make as a young startup is going after a
giant market from the get-go. That signifies that you haven't defined
categories correctly. And you're going to be dealing with too much
competition in one way or another.

Even Amazon started with just a bookstore. Their selling point was that
they had all the books in the world for sale online. After they
established themselves as a bookstore, they expanded into different
types of e-commerce.

In the tech world, there's this feeling that, in technology's history,
evey moment happens only once, so your company needs to be unique.

In Thiel's words: "You don't want to be the fourth online pet food
company. You don't want to be the tenth solar panel company ... All
unhappy companies are alike because they failed to escape the essential
sameness in competition."

"The next Mark Zuckerberg won't build a social network and the next
Larry Page won't be building a search engine, and the next Bill Gates
won't be building an operating system. If you are copying these people,
you are not learning from them," Thiel said.

## Last Mover Advantage
You want technology with a magnitude that is 10x better than the next
best thing, and you want it to last.
