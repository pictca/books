## You goal as a founder
Think of your business as an engine.

"At first you have to a drawing on a white board and you are are
architecting it looks especially clean, beautiful, and pretty. But when
you actually start translating it to practice, it actually starts
looking more [rough] and you're holding it together with duct tape,"
said Rabois.

Just holding it together takes a lot of effort, and getting it to look
like polished metal will tale even more. "You want to construct a very
high-performance machine," said Robois. "A machine that almost nobody
really has to worry has to worry about."

As the leader, he said it's your job to maximize output and keep your
focus there instead of on the input, Only measure your progress.

Most of the time, especially in the beginning, it's going to feel like
madness because it probably is. Robois said that's not only normal, it's
good.

"If you have too much process, too much predictability, you are probably not innovating fast enough
and creatively enough ... It should feel like every day there is a new
problem and what you are doing is fundamentally triaging."

To keep with the medical analogy, he said it's the difference between
knowing which problems are fatal and which ones aren't. To have enough
perspective and distance to do that, you have to make sure that you're
editing, not writing.
