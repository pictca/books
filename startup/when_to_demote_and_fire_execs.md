# When to Demote and When to fire Execs
When managing a startup, there are going to be problems that pop up that
you might not have covered in business school or even  in the early days
of your startup.

One of them is having an upper-level employee who works hard, but just
isn't great at his job. How do you decide whether to demote or fire him.

## The scenario
An executive has worked really hard for your company, and the team like
him. All in all he is a great assets to the company culture, but he's
not exemplary when it comes to the job you need him to be doing.

It's a really hard decision and to make things even more complex,
Horowitz said that you have to consider the perspective of everyone
involved: the CEO, the executive, and the rest of the team.

 - CEO's Perspective
    Demotion is ideal because you can keep the employee and harness his
    skill in a position that's better suited for him. Also, you don't
    create a hole in the culture by letting him go.

 - Executive's Perspective
    He doesn't want a demotion, but it gives an alternative to
    termination. Also, it much easier to explain (and/or sugarcoat) a
    demotion to a future employer rather than explaining being fired.

 - Company Culture
    If you do demote a person, how are the other people on the team
    going to treat him? What shifts is this going to cause in the
    company's dynamics?

## Horowitz's Solution
At the end of the day, the decision you're making doesn't just affect
one person, and the results last longer than one day or one week.

"What you really doing is saying, what does it mean to fail on the job?
Particularly the highest paid, the highest compensated job in the
company," Horowitz explained. "Is it good enough to put in an effort or
do you have to get a result?"

After you've carefully considered the repercussions of either choice
from all angles (including equity), you'll be able to balance the
options.

Horoitz said to keep in mind that if you're firing someone, it's a
failure: "You failed on hiring. You failed on integrating. They failed
at their job ... The reason they fail on the job is you made some
mistake in the hiring process and you didn't match them to the needs of
your company accurately enough."
