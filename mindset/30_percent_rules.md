## Steve Jobs Used the 30 Percent Rule to Bring Apple Back From the Dead (It'll Work for You, Too)
### By focusing on the best of the best, Jobs transformed Apple into one of the most valuable companies in the world.


#### When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company was in dire straits. Once known as a major innovator, it was suffering from severe mismanagement and lack of focus. Apple had built its reputation on simplicity and quality, but it was now working on a plethora of products, many of which were lackluster at best.

>  he reveals one of the secrets that would lead to Apple's future success:

##### We examined the future product roadmap ... and what we found was that 30 percent of them were incredibly good. And about 70 percent of them were either pretty good, or things that we didn't really need to be doing. Businesses we didn't really need to be in. And so, we've pared a lot of that back, so we could focus the same amount of original resource even more on what was remaining--and add a few new things in.
So, the resources that we're investing are equal or greater than we have been, but it's on fewer things so we're going to do a better job at them I think.'

### Why you need the 30 percent rule
As you move from one shiny object to another, you'll slowly discover a fundamental truth:

> You can't do everything. And if you try, you won't do anything well.

#### So, you have to ask yourself:
- Am I making the best use of my resources?
- Am I focused on the 30 percent--that is, making the best of the best?
- Or am I wasting time on distractions?
