Happiness is in looking at the glass and seeing the truth of the glass.
Seeing the half full side and being grateful for it.
Seeing the half empty side and saying,can I do anything about it.
And if not,can I accept it?

Truly, happiness is not about what the world gives you, how much water is in this glass.Happiness is what you think about what the world gives you.

Happiness is equal to, or greater than the difference between the way you see the events of your life and your expectation of how life should behave.
So if life meets your expectations, you're happy.

We mix tow states, one of them is happiness and the other is fun.

Happiness is that peaceful, contentment feeling of,
"I like the world as it is right now."

"Fun" is the modern world's replacement of happiness.
 When I'm unable to reach that state of happiness,what I do is ,I go out
 on the weekend and I go to a party and  'boom boom boom boom', and my
 brain stops thinking.As long as it stops thinking, I think I feel
 happy. Not because I'm actually in that peaceful state of happiness,
 but because I suspended my unhappy thoughts.
 You can either chose to suffer or I can chose to sort of accept life ,
 as harsh as it has become and reset , make that the zero point,and try
 to make it slightly better than it is today,and make it slightly better
 tomorrow.
