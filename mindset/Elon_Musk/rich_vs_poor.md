# Rich or Poor
Elon Musk explains why his daughter can't marry a poor man.

A few years ago there was a conference in the United State on investment
and finance. One of the speakers was Elon Musk and during the question
and answer session, he was asked a question that had everyone laughing.

If he, the richest man in the world, cloud accept that his daughter
marry a poor or modest man.

His answer can change something in everyone.

Elon Musk: 
    First of all, understand that, Wealth does not mean having a
fat bank account. Wealth is primarily the ability to create wealth.
    Example, Someone who wins the lottery or gambling. Even if he wins
    100 millions is not a rich man. He is a poor man with a lot of
    money. That's the reason why 90% of the lottery millionaires become
    poor again after 5 years.

    You also have rich people who have no money.
    Example,  Most entrepreneurs.
    They're already on the road to wealth even though they have no
    money, because they are developing their financial intelligence and
    that is wealth.

## How are the rich and the poor different?
    To put it simply, The rich may die to become rich, while the poor
    may kill to become rich.

    If you see a young person to decides to train, to learn new things,
    who tries to improve himself constantly, know that he is a rich man.
    
    If you see a young person who thinks that the problem is the state,
    and who thinks that the rich are all thieves and who criticizes
    constantly, know that, he is poor man.

    The rich are convinced that they just need information and trainging
    to take off, the poor think that others must give them money to take
    off.

    In concluision, when I say that my daughter will not marry a poor
    man, I am not talking about money, I'm talking about the ability to
    create wealth in that man.

    Excuse me for saying this, but most criminals are poor people. When
    they are in front of money they lose their mind, that's why they
    rob, steal etc...  For them it is a frace because they don't know
    how they could earn money by themselves.

    One day, the guard of a bank found a bag full of money, he took the
    bag and went to give it to the bank manager.

    People called this man an idiot, but in reality this man was just a
    rich man who had no money.

    One year later, the bank offered him a job as a receptionist, 3
    years later he wasa a customer manager and 10 years later he manages
    the regional management of this bank, he manages hundreds of
    employees and his annual bonus exceeds the amount he could have
    stole.

    Wealth is first of all a state of mind.
