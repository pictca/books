## 1. Make something useful
 - Above all else, you should not go into business purely for financial
 reasons. Running a company involves long hours and hard decisions.
  If you don't have a better reason than money to keep you going, your
  business will more than likely fail, as many new businesses do.
  So, it's important to create something of use that is going to benefit
  society as a whole.
  If you do something you truly care about, you will be in a much better
  position to find customers, connect with them, and keep them coming
  back. 

## 2. Simplify your message
 - Your message must be a dead simple. Customers don't just shop for a
 brand and its products, but also identify with its core values. Ask
 yourself, "Why did I start my business?"
  Be honest -- this will help you establish an authentic value and
  voice. Then break your message into something simple.
  like Virgin - Great customer service, good value, and innovative
  alternatives to our competitors' offerings.

## 3. Market yourself
 - My mentor, Sir Freddie Laker, a man who had started a company to
 challenge British Airways on their home turf, gave me some invaluable
 advice when I was starting up Virgin Atlantic. Knowing that we couldn't
 match the more established airlines in terms of marketing budget, he
 encouraged me to drive the publicity myself: 
    Use yourself. Make a fool of yourself. Otherwise you won't survive.
I took his advice, and I've been thinking up fun ways to stand out from
the crowd and draw the media's attention to our company ever since.

## 4. Embrace social media
 - Social media is not only more cost-efficient than advertising, but it
 also offers great opportunities for innovative engagement with your
 customers. In my experience, selling a product through social media
 doesn't always work -- it's better to simply communicate with your
 customers in an authentic way and have fun. As you build an online
 profile that people can identify with and trust, you'll find that they
 will soon become customers.

## 5. Enjoy what you do.
 - If you genuinely love and believe in what you do, others will take
 notice and share your enthusiasm. If you find your interest flagging,
 it's time to make a change -- switch from operations to management,
 move on, expand into new territories, anything that interests you.
 To find success, you need to be fully committed or your work will show
 it.
