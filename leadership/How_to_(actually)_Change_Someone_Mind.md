## Summary.
    Much of leadership boils down to turning adversaries into allies. In
    this piece, the authors discuss three persuasion strategies leaders
    can employ when faced with a disagreement in the workplace: the
    Cognitive Conversation, which is best for convincing colleagues
    focused on the rational reasons behind a decision, the Champion
    Conversation, which is best for convincing colleagues with whom you
    have a strained relationship, and the Credible Colleague Approach,
    which is best for convincing someone who has preconceived notions
    that you're unlikely to be able to change on your own. Armed with
    these three methods, leaders can modulate their arguments - in terms
    of both content and presentation - to maximize their chances of
    reaching an agreement and preserving a positive working
    relationship.


If you're leader, it's likely that not everyone who works with you will
agree with the decisions you make - and that's okay. Leadership involves
making unpopular decisions while navigating complex relationships with
colleagues, partners, and clients. But often, you will need to get
buy-in from these constituents, and therefore you will need to
convince them to change their mind.

There is little friction involved in convincing people who are your
natural supporters. But trying to change the mind of a dissenter, or a
detractor, is a different story. How do you go about convincing someone
who, for one reason or another, doesn't see eye-to-eye with you? Someone
who give a flat out "no"?

In the recent research we completed for Laura's book, Edge: Turning
Adversity into Advantage, we observed, and then interviewed, more than
60 leaders who were trying to convince business associates and other
constituents to change their minds on a course of action that they
initially disagreed with. The leaders who were most successful in
overcoming other' skepticism were those who diagnosed the root of the
fundamental disagreement before trying to persuade. They first asked
themselves, "What's driving my detractor's resistance?" These leaders
often pinpointed which aspects of their arguments elicited the most
pushback and the most emotional reactions. Then, depending on the
answer, they approached the situation with one of the following three
targeted strategies.

## The Cognitive Conversation
### When to use it:
    The detractor may be opposed to your argument because of an
    objective reason. If they've clearly articulated a logical set aside
    emotions in their decision-making process.

### How it works:
    A successful cognitive conversation requires two things: Sound
    arguments and good presentation. Take, for example, a situation
    where you are pushing to switch suppliers and you've found one whose
    materials and products are superior to the current suppliers, whose
    products have been causing numerous downstream issues. But your
    colleague is in favor of sticking with your current suppliers with
    whom he has a long-standing relationship. He expresses his
    resistance to your proposal by pointing out the higher prices the
    new supplier charges. You want to prepare sound arguments that
    disprove the detractor's objections. In this instance, you might
    point out that the new supplier is actually less expensive in the
    long run, when you take into account all the additional production
    costs by the current suppliers. You also want to use a logical
    framework and clear storyline to force the detractor to reassess
    their thinking. For example, you can emphasize that the decision is
    based on cost, quality, and service, but above all, cost and
    quality.

Be cautions about not introducing emotions into the discussion, which
could give the impression that you and your detractor are not on common
ground. For example, you don't want to make it seem as if you believe
your colleague's relationship with the former suppliers is irrelevant.
The goal is to show the person that, on an objective and factual basis,
their initial stance on the situation isn't as reasonable as your
argument. Be warned, these detractors are not easily swayed by broad
generalizations. Be ready to mentally spar with them and come prepared
with facts that back up each aspect of your overall argument.

### The catch:
    Don't assume that getting a "yes" from this type of detractor
    signals a conversion into an everlasting supporters. You may have
    persuaded them on this specific issue, but they may disagree with
    you again in the future. If that's true, expect to have anothe
    cognitive conversation on that separate argument.

## The Champion Conversion
### When to use it:
    When the detractor isn't easily persuaded through cognitive
    arguments, or when they harbor a grievance in your relationship
    with them, engaging in debates may be futile. Take, for example, a
    management decision where you'd like to promote a qualified
    individual who performed brilliantly under your supervision, but a
    counterpart of yours argues that your subordinates often get
    promoted over hers. Even if your promotion canidate is obkectively
    more deserving, others may still fee resentment and refuse to
    provide support.

### How it work:
    Don't jump in and try to convince thre other person. Instead, invest
    time in personally learning about and building rapport with them.
    Here, it's not about arguments or presentation, at least initially,
    but understanding their perspective and why they might feel
    personally affronted. For instance, you might ask questions about
    her team, and which team members she feels have them most potential.
    Gradually convert this detractor into someone wh is your champion
    or advocate, perhaps by shedding more light on the qualities that
    you value in individuals, both on your team as well as your 
    counterpart's team, or showing how you value her leadership style. By
    the time the decision must be made, try to make sure you're both on
    the same page as to which qualities matter for promotion decisions
    and that you've clearly articulated how you candidate exemplifies
    those qualities.

### Tthe catch:
    no matter how much of a champion the other person becomes, don't
    expect them to agree with a decision that's fundamentally illogical.
    You can't rely on relationship alone; you stance still needs to be
    backed by clear logic. Additionally, these types of detractors can
    easily sense if you're trying to manipulate the situation to get
    them on your side. Authenticity is key: allow the other person to
    see who you are so that they can more fully understand your point of
    view.

## The credible Colleague Approach
### When to use it:
    THere are times when the detractor's deeply-held personal beliefs
    make them fundamentally opposed to your proposal. Take, for example,
    a colleague who might disagree with you to the need to run a
    necessary clinical trial for a new product. Because they believe
    that the clinical trial for a new product. Because they believe that
    the clinical trial might be harmful in someway or run counter to
    their values, they oppose the idea, even though the evidence shows
    that the benefits out weight the harm. It's sometimes tough to
    pinpoint where these personal beliefs stem from, but some
    combination of the person's upbringing, personal history, and
    unspoken biases will, at times, make it seemingly impossible for
    them to accept a decision, no matter what logical or motional
    argument you thrown their way. In these situations, there isn't much
    you can say or do to change their mind.

### How it work:
    Rather than trying to argue with someone who seems resistant, bring
    in credible colleague. A champion of your position from another part
    of the organization, whether they are a peer or superior, may be
    better-suited to convince this detractor. This forces the detractor
    to disentangle who you are from what your argument might be and
    evaluate the idea based on its objective merits. If you and the
    detractor are at an impasses, the credible colleague might just tip
    the scales in your favor.

### The catch:
    Calling in an external supporter is a double-edged sword. While it
    can achieve the outcome you want, it may exacerbate your detractor's
    opposition, especially if the detractor feels that the credible
    colleague has forced them to take your side. It's critical to find
    the right colleague who can tactfully advocate for your position
    while maintaining a cordial relationship.

It's not easy to have detractors, and it's even harder to change their
minds. The key to understand the source of their resistance and use a
targeted strategy the best resonate with your particular detractor.
You'll have a much better chance of getting a "yes."
