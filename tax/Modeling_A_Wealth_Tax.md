# Modeling a Wealth Tax
### August 2020

Some politicians are proposing to introduce wealth taxes in addition to
income and capital gains taxes. Let's try modeling the effects of
various levels of wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for
a startup founder.

Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then live
for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax consume?

If the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy to calulate its
effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep 99% of your stock each
year. After 60 years the proportion of stock you'll have left will be
.99^60, or .547. So a straight 1% wealth tax means the government will
over the course of your life take 45% of your stock.

(Losing shares doesn't not, obviously, mean becoming net poorer unless
the value per share is increasing by less than the wealth tax rate.)


Here's how much stock the government would take over 60 years at various
levels of wealth tax:

| wealth tax | government takes |
| ---------- | ------|
| 0.1% | 6 % |
| 0.5% | 26% |
| 1.0% | 45% |
| 2.0% | 70% |
| 3.0% | 84% |
| 4.0% | 91% |
| 5.0% | 95% |

It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates
produce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax with a $50 million
threshould takes about two thirds of a successful founder's stock.

The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they're
applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year,
but only to that year's income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after
acquiring some asset, a wealth tax will tax that same asset 60 time. A
wealth tax compounds.
