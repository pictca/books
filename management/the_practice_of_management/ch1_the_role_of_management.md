## The dynamic element in every business -- A distinct and a leading
group -- The emergence of management -- The free world's stake of
management
---
The manager is the dynamic, life-giving element in every business.
Without his leadership the "resource of production" remain re-source and
never become production. In a competitive economy, above all, the
quality and performance of the manager determine the success of a
business, indeed they determine its survival. For the quality and
performance of its managers is the only effective advantage an
enterprise in a competitive economy can have.

Management is also a distinct and a leading group in industrial society.
We no longer talk of "capital" and "labor"; we talk of "management" and
"labor". The "responsibilities of capital" have disappeared from out
vocabulary together with the "rights of capital"; instead, we hear of
the "responsibilities of management" and (a singularly hapless phrase)
of the "prerogatives of management." We are building up a comprehensive
and distinct system of "education for management." And when the
Eisenhower Administration was formed in 1952, it was formed consciously
as a "Management Administration."
