##### How do you use small stories at work? Start by understanding the seven characteristics of a good business story:

> **Time**. Stories occur at a certain moment. When you hear someone say, "Last week, this happened," that's the beginning of a story.

> **Place**. For each story, you can picture a pin on a map. Here's an example: "We were at the sales meeting in Phoenix."

> **People**. Movies may feature animals or aliens, but for business storytellers the focus is on people. "Here's how Joe overcame that obstacle..." or "The quality team needed to fix that glitch."

> **A series of events**. Stories describe what happened first, then next, then after that. And the best stories have built-in tension. "When the system failed, our team had to quickly develop a way around the problem."

> **Surprise**. Writes Callahan: "A story is a promise to share something the audience doesn't know. To qualify as a story, there must be something in it that's unanticipated. It doesn't have to be a great insight, but listeners should at least raise their eyebrows."

> **Relevance**. Many stories you hear at work are entertaining, but aren't particularly illuminating. The best business stories provide context that supports the strategy or another key issue.

> **Emotion**. As Callahan explains, "A story describes what happened. A good story helps you see what happened. And a great story helps you feel what happened."

##### Once you're comfortable identifying stories, you'll notice that they're everywhere in your organization. Now it's time to incorporate stories into your communication.

"While the storytelling habit takes time to develop, you don't have to be regimented to be successful," writes Callahan. "Look for times when you can make a point, tell a story to reinforce it, and collect your rewards from the faces of the people around you."

#### Here are 5 reasons why you should consider using stories every time you want to get someone's attention, make a case, gain approval and sell a service, product or idea:

> **We want to be entertained**, not lectured to. A story makes us think: "This is going to be fun," not, "Am I going to be tested on this?"

> **Stories teach subtly and indirectly**. Instead of hitting us over the head, stories imply the message. As historian and social philosopher Hannah Arendt said, "Storytelling reveals meaning without committing the error of defining it."

> **We can (safely) experience emotions**. In most other forms of "official" communication, emotion is off-limits. Yet we (even men) are actually drawn to emotions: We want to laugh, cry, be scared and feel better afterwards. That is a heck of a lot better than another boring memo or a 10-page corporate white paper.

> **Stories feel genuine, not packaged or spun**. As Christopher Locke writes in Gonzo Marketing, the Internet has created a new "campfire" that encourages the free exchange of stories. "We have gotten used to talking amongst ourselves in uncontrived, unpremeditated human voices." And now companies have to do the same. "Not the smarmy, cloyingly sentimental 'human interest' stories businesses are so fond of leveraging in support of some arcane brand mysticism, but rather, stories that come from actually grappling with the...problem the service purports to solve."

> **The experience of a story draws people together**. Here's Christopher Locke again (who is obviously a strong advocate of the power of stories): "The best stories can become myths that draw people together, create entire cultures. The people within the culture so created are not strangers to each other precisely because they know the old stories. They share and reflect on them. They remember together. This creates powerful cohesion, even identity."

So "Once upon a time . . ." still works. That's the value of stories.
