### The Pmarca guide to startups
---
## Why not to do a startup - P1
> **In an established company** — no matter how poorly run or
demoralized — things happen. They just happen. People come
in to work. Code gets written. User interfaces get designed.
Servers get provisioned. Markets get analyzed. Pricing gets stud-
ied and determined. Sales calls get made. The wastebaskets get
emptied. And so on.
A startup has none of the established systems, rhythms, infra-
structure that any established company has.

> You as the founder have to put all of these systems and routines
and habits in place and get everyone actually rowing — forget
even about rowing in the right direction: just rowing at all is
hard enough at the start.

> And until you do, absolutely nothing happens.
Unless, of course, you do it yourself.
Have fun emptying those wastebaskets.
Third, you get told no — a lot.

> You’re going to get told no by potential employees, potential
investors, potential customers, potential partners, reporters,
analysts... Over and over and over

### there are many more reasons to not do a startup
1. a startup puts you on an emotional rollercoaster
2. in a startup, absolutely nothing happens unless you make it happen.
3. you get told no — a lot.
4. hiring is a huge pain in the ass.
5. God help you, at some point you’re going to have to hire executives.
6. the hours. The fact is that startups are incredibly intense experiences and take a lot out of people in the best of circumstances
7. it’s really easy for the culture of a startup to go sideways.
8. there are lots of X factors that can come along and whup you right upside the head, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about them.

## When the VCs say "no"
### 1. lay the groundwork to go back in later.
> It’s an old — and true — cliche that VCs rarely actually say “no”
— more oaen they say “maybe”, or “not right now”, or “my part-
ners aren’t sure”, or “that’s interesting, let me think about it”.
They do that because they don’t want to invest in your company
given the current facts, but they want to keep the door open in
case the facts change.
> One “no” doesn’t mean anything — the VC could just be having
a bad day, or she had a bad experience with another company in
your category, or she had a bad experience with another com-
pany with a similar name, or she had a bad experience with
another founder who kind of looks like you, or her Mercedes
SLR McLaren’s engine could have blown up on the freeway that
morning — it could be anything. Go meet with more VCs.

### 2. consider the environment.
> we’re now in a much more rational environment
than either of those extremes — a lot of good plans are being
funded, along with some bad ones, but not all the bad ones.
### 3. retool your plan.
> ### onion theory of risk.
If you’re an investor, you look at the risk around an investment
as if it’s an onion. Just like you peel an onion and remove each
layer in turn, risk in a startup investment comes in layers that
get peeled away — reduced — one by one.
#### What are the layers of risk for a high-tech startup?
1. `Founder risk` - does the startup have the right founding team? include a great technologist?,
Is the business person missing from the team altogether?
2. `Market risk` - Will anyone want it? Will
they pay for it? How much will they pay? How do we know?
3. `Competition risk` - Is this startup suZciently diWerentiated from the other startups, and also diWerentiated from any large incumbents?
4. `Timing risk` — is it too early? Is it too late?
5. `Financing risk` — after we invest in this round, how many additional rounds of financing will be required for the company to become proXtable, and what will the dollar total be? How certain are we about these estimates? How do we know?
6. `Marketing risk` — will this startup be able to cut through the noise? How much will marketing cost? Do the economics of customer acquisition — the cost to acquire a customer, and the revenue that customer will generate — work?
7. `Distribution risk` — does this startup need certain distribution partners to succeed? Will it be able to get them? How? (For example, this is a common problem with mobile startups that need deals with major mobile carriers to succeed.)
8. `Technology risk` — can the product be built? Does it involve rocket science — or an equivalent, like artiXcial intelligence or natural language processing? Are there fundamental breakthroughs that need to happen? If so, how certain are we that they will happen, or that this team will be able to make them?
9. `Product risk` — even assuming the product can in theory be built, can this team build it?
10. `Hiring risk` — what positions does the startup need to hire for in order to execute its plan? E.g. a startup planning to build a high- scale web service will need a VP of Operations — will the found- ing team be able to hire a good one?
11. `Location risk` — where is the startup located? Can it hire the right talent in that location? And will I as the VC need to drive more than 20 minutes in my Mercedes SLR McLaren to get there?
> put yourself in the VC’s shoes: what could this startup do to minimize or eliminate enough of these risks to make the company fundable?
### Some ideas on reducing risk
1. `Founder risk` - add one to more founder 
2. `Market risk` - you probably need to validate the market, at a practical level. Sometimes more detailed and analytical market research will solve the problem, but more oaen you actually need to go get some customers to demonstrate that the market exists. Preferably, paying customers. Or at least credible prospects who will talk to VCs to validate the market hypothesis.
3. `Competition risk` - Rethink this one from the ground up. If you don’t have a really solid idea as to how you’re dramatically diWerent from or advantaged over known and unknown competitors, you might not want to start a company in the Xrst place.
> Never, ever say your market projections indicate you’re going to be hugely successful if you get only 2% of your (extremely large) market.

> Never, ever say that you have no competitors. That signals naivete. Great markets draw competitors, and so if you really have no competition, you must not be in a great market.

4. `Timing risk` — the only thing to do here is to make more progress, and demonstrate that you’re not too early or too late. Getting customers in the bag is the most valuable thing you can do on this one.
5. `Financing risk` — rethink very carefully how much money you will need to raise aaer this round of Xnancing, and try to change the plan in plausible ways to require less money.
6. `Marketing risk` — First, make sure your differentiation is super sharp, because without that, you probably won’t be able to stand out from the noise.
> Then, model out your customer acquisition economics in detail
and make sure that you can show how you’ll get more revenue from a customer than it will cost in sales and marketing expense to acquire that customer. This is a common problem for startups pursuing the small business market,
7. `Distribution risk` - if your plan has distribution risk, which is to say you need a key distribution partner to make it work, personally I’d recommend shelving the plan and doing something else. Otherwise, you may need to go get the distribution deal before you can raise money, which is almost impossible. 
8. `Technology risk` — there’s only one way around this, which is to build the product
9. `Product risk` — same answer — build it.
10. `Hiring risk` - add it/them to the founding team. This will mean additional dilution for you, but it’s probably the only way to solve the problem
11. `Location risk` - move to where money is. You can start a company wherever you want, but you may not be able to get it funded there.
> #### further down the road — make more progress against your plan before you raise venture capital.

> The whole theory of venture capital is that VCs are investing in risk — another term for venture capital is “risk capital” — but the reality is that VCs will only take on so much risk, and the best thing you can do to optimize your chances of raising money is to take out risk.

> **Peel away at the onion.** -`So keep your options open all the way to the end`.

## "But I don't know any VCs!" - P3
> The starting point for raising money from VCs when you don’t know any VCs is to realize that VCs work mostly **through referrals**

### Now, on to developing contacts
> The best way to develop contacts with VCs, in my opinion, is to work at a venture-backed startup, kick butt, get promoted, and network the whole way.
0. join community or education relate to venture like MIT.
1. `Read VC blogs` — read them all, and read them very very care- fully. VCs who blog are doing entrepreneurs a huge service both in conveying highly useful information as well as frequently putting themselves out there to be contacted by entrepreneurs in various ways including email, comments, and even uploaded podcasts. Each VC is diWerent in terms of how she wants to engage with people online, but by all means read as many VC blogs as you can and interact with as many of them as you can in appropriate ways.
2. Create or contribute to a meaningful open source project. if you have
   time
#### If none of those ideas work for you
> **Tried** angel funding, bootstrapping via consulting contracts or early customers, keeping your day job and
working on your startup in your spare time, and credit card debt.

### The only thing that matters - P4
#### Q1. what’s most dangerous: a bad team, a weak product, or a poor market?
> Market is the most important factor in a startup’s success or failure. Why? In a great market

> A market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup. The market needs to be fulXlled and the market will be fulXlled, by the Xrst viable product that comes along. The product doesn’t need to be great; it just has to basically work. And, the market doesn’t care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product. In short, customers are knocking down your door to get the product; the main goal is to actually answer the phone and respond to all the emails from people who want to buy.
## RachleE’s Law of Startup Success:
> The #1 company-killer is lack of market.
- When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins.
- When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.
- When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.
##### `Markets that don’t exist don’t care how smart you are.`
#### Q2. Can’t great products sometimes create huge new markets?
> This is a best case scenario,VMWare - VMWare’s product was so profoundly transformative out of the gate that it catalyzed a whole new movement toward operating system virtualization, which turns out to be a monster market.

> ****Understand I’m not saying that you should shoot low in terms of quality of team, or that VMWare’s team was not incredibly strong — it was, and is. I’m saying, bring a product as transformative as VMWare’s to market and you’re going to succeed, full stop.****

#### Q.3 As a startup founder, what should I do about all this?
> RachleE’s Corollary of Startup Success: **The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit.**
##### And you can always feel product/market Fit when it’s happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it
It's devided into 2 part  - "`BPMF`" (Before product/market fit) and "`APMF`" (After product/market fit)
> When you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit.

 Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don’t want to, telling customers yes when you don’t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital — whatever is required. When you get right down to it, you can ignore almost everything else.

> Whenever you see a successful startup, you see one that has reached product/market fit 

Ironically, once a startup is successful, and you ask the founders what made it successful, they will usually cite all kinds of things that had nothing to do with it. People are terrible at understanding causation. But in almost every case, the cause was actually product/market fit.

#### The Moby Dick theory of big companies - P5
The inside of any big company is a very, very complex system
consisting of many thousands of people, of whom at least hun-
dreds and probably thousands are executives who think they
have some level of decision-making authority.

On any given issue, many people inside the company are going
to get some kind of vote on what happens — maybe 8 people,
maybe 10, 15, 20, sometimes many more.

> “The larger whales, whalers seldom venture to attack. They stand in so great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper- wood, and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to terrify and prevent their too near approach.” 
> - Uno Von Troil’s Letters on Banks’s and Solander’s Voyage to Iceland In 1772

##### The downside of dealing with a big company is that he can capize you — maybe by stepping on you in one way or another and killing you, but more likely by wrapping you up in a bad partnership that ends up holding you back, or just making you waste a huge amount of time in meetings and get distracted from your core mission.

### So what to do?
> ##### 1. Don’t do startups that require deals with big companies to make them successful.
> ##### 2. Never assume that a deal with a big company is closed until the ink hits the paper and/or the cash hits the company bank account.
> ##### 3. Be extremely patient.
> ##### 4. Beware bad deals.
> ##### 5. Never, ever assume a big company will do the obvious thing.
> ##### 6. Be aware that big companies care a lot more about what other big companies are doing than what any startup is doing.
> ##### 7. If doing deals with big companies is going to be a key part of your strategy, be sure to hire a real pro who has done it before.
> ##### 8. Don’t get obsessed.Always be ready to have the conversation just drop and to return to your core business.

#### How much funding is too little? Too much? - P6
We talk to startup life can be divided into 2 part - BPMF / APMF
- ***Before Product/Market Fit***, a startup should ideally raise at least enough money to get to Product/Market Fit.
- ***After Product/Market Fit***, a startup should ideally raise at least enough money to fully exploit the opportunity in front of it, and then to get to profitability while still fully exploiting that opportunity.
##### What if you can’t raise that much money at once?
- If you are `Before` Product/Market Fit and you can’t raise enough money in one shot to get to Product/Market Fit, then you will need get as far as you can on each round and demonstrate progress towards Product/Market Fit when you raise each new round.
- If you are `After` Product/Market Fit and you can’t raise enough money in one shot to fully exploit your opportunity, you have a high-class problem and will probably — but not definitely that it gets continually easier to raise new money as you need it.
#### nWhat are the consequences of not raising enough money?
- First, you may have — and probably will have — unanticipated setbacks within your business.
- Second, the funding window may not be open when you need more money.
- Third, something completely unanticipated, and bad, might happen.
> ##### So how much money should I raise?
That is liquidation preference. In the scenario where your company ultimately gets acquired: the more money you raise from outside investors, the higher the acquisition price has to be for the founders and employees to make money on top of the initial payout to the investors.
> raising a lot of money can make it much harder to effectively sell your company for less than a very high price, which you may not be able to get when the time comes.
##### in a normal scenario, raising more money rather than less usually makes sense, since you are buying yourself insurance against both internal and external potential bad events
#### How much money is too much?
- ***Raising money is never an accomplishment in and of itself*** — it just raises the stakes for all the hard work you would have had to do anyway: actually building your business.
##### Some signs of cultural corrosion caused by raising too much money:
- `Hiring too many people` - slows everything down and makes it much harder for you to react and change
- `Lazy management culture` - It's will suffers with potentially disastrous long-term consequences to morale and effeciveness
- `Engineering team bloat` — another side effect of hiring too many people; Your best people get frustrated and quit, and you’re in huge trouble.
- Lack of focus on product and customers
- `Too many salespeople too soon` — out selling a product that isn’t quite ready yet, hasn’t yet achieved Product/Market Fit
- `Product schedule slippage`
> #### The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing

> Continue to run as lean as you can, bank as much of the money as possible, and save it for a rainy day — or a nuclear winter.

|WARNING: :warning: The easiest way to lose control of your spending when you raise too much money is to hire too many people. The second easiest way is to pay people too much. Worry more about the Xrst one than the second one; more people multiply spending a lot faster than a few raises.|

#### Why a startup's initial business plan doesn't matter that much
> It is therefore much more important for a startup to aggressively seek out a big market, and product/market Ft within that market, once the startup is up and running, than it is to try to plan out what you are going to do in great detail ahead of time.
### Hiring
#### Hiring, managing, promoting, and firing executives - P8
---
> The manager may ask what the right thing to do is; the executive should know.

> the output of an executive is the output of her organization.
#### In a startup, a successful executive must accomplish three other critical tasks simultaneously:
- ***Build her organization*** - Isn’t there to be a caretaker; rather she must build her organization,often from scratch.
- ***Be a primary individual contributor*** – a startup executive must “roll up her sleeves” and produce output herself.
- ***Be a team player*** – a startup executive must take personal responsibility for her relationships with her peers and people throughout the startup, in all functions and at all levels.
###### Hiring
1. if you’re not sure whether you need an executive for a function, don’t hire one.
> Particularly before a startup has achieved product/ market fit, it is often better to have a ***`highly motivated manager`*** or ***`director`*** running a function than an executive.
- Hire an executive only when it’s clear that you need one: when an organization needs to get built; when hiring needs to accelerate;
> when you need more processes and structure and rigor to how you do things.
- hire the best person for the next nine months, not the next three years.
2. Hire for what you need now
> and for roughly the next nine months. At the very least, you will get what you need now, and the person you hire may well be able to scale and keep going for years to come.
3. Whenever possible, promote from within
4. key things to look at, and for, When evaluating executive canidates:
> Look for someone who is hungry and driven

> Flip side of that: beware people who have “done it before”

> Don’t disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness

> Beware hiring a big company executive for a startup

> In particular, really beware hiring an executive from an incredibly successful big company. This is often very tempting.
> **let them go somewhere else and fail, and then hire them”. Believe it.**

> This probably goes without saying, but look for a pattern of
output– accomplishment. Validate it by reference checking
peers, reports, and bosses. Along the way, reference check
personality and teamwork, but look Xrst and foremost for a
pattern of output.

5. By all means, use an executive recruiter, but for sourcing, not evaluation.
> It’s your job to evaluate and make the decision, not the recruiter’s.

6. Be ready to pay market compensation 
> including more cash  - compensation than you want, but watch for red Gags in the compensation discussion

> Watch out for candidates who want egregious amounts of cash, high bonuses, restricted stock, vacation days, perks, or — worst of all — guaranteed severance. A candidates who is focused on those things, as opposed to the option package, is not ready to do a startup.

7. When hiring the executive to run your former specialty, be careful you don’t hire someone weak on purpose.
> make sure the person you hire into that role is way better than you used to be.

8. Recognize that hiring an executive is a high-risk proposition.
> if you know what you’re doing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about 50/50. That is, about 50% of the time you’ll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person.

#### Managing
1. manage your executives.
> You should nevertheless manage every executive as if she were a normal employee. This means weekly 1:1’s, performance reviews, written objectives,

2. Give your executives the latitude to run their organizations.
> if you want to give an executive full latitude, but you’re reluctant to do so because you’re not sure she can make it happen, then it’s probably time to fire her.

3. Ruthlessly violate the chain of command in order to gather data.
> A great executive never minds when the CEO talks to people in her organization.
