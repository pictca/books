### The Pmarca guide to startups

## Why not to do a startup - P1
> **In an established company** — no matter how poorly run or
demoralized — things happen. They just happen. People come
in to work. Code gets written. User interfaces get designed.
Servers get provisioned. Markets get analyzed. Pricing gets stud-
ied and determined. Sales calls get made. The wastebaskets get
emptied. And so on.
A startup has none of the established systems, rhythms, infra-
structure that any established company has.

> You as the founder have to put all of these systems and routines
and habits in place and get everyone actually rowing — forget
even about rowing in the right direction: just rowing at all is
hard enough at the start.

> And until you do, absolutely nothing happens.
Unless, of course, you do it yourself.
Have fun emptying those wastebaskets.
Third, you get told no — a lot.

> You’re going to get told no by potential employees, potential
investors, potential customers, potential partners, reporters,
analysts... Over and over and over

### there are many more reasons to not do a startup
1. a startup puts you on an emotional rollercoaster
2. in a startup, absolutely nothing happens unless you make it happen.
3. you get told no — a lot.
4. hiring is a huge pain in the ass.
5. God help you, at some point you’re going to have to hire executives.
6. the hours. The fact is that startups are incredibly intense experiences and take a lot out of people in the best of circumstances
7. it’s really easy for the culture of a startup to go sideways.
8. there are lots of X factors that can come along and whup you right upside the head, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about them.

## When the VCs say "no"
### 1. lay the groundwork to go back in later.
> It’s an old — and true — cliche that VCs rarely actually say “no”
— more oaen they say “maybe”, or “not right now”, or “my part-
ners aren’t sure”, or “that’s interesting, let me think about it”.
They do that because they don’t want to invest in your company
given the current facts, but they want to keep the door open in
case the facts change.
> One “no” doesn’t mean anything — the VC could just be having
a bad day, or she had a bad experience with another company in
your category, or she had a bad experience with another com-
pany with a similar name, or she had a bad experience with
another founder who kind of looks like you, or her Mercedes
SLR McLaren’s engine could have blown up on the freeway that
morning — it could be anything. Go meet with more VCs.

### 2. consider the environment.
> we’re now in a much more rational environment
than either of those extremes — a lot of good plans are being
funded, along with some bad ones, but not all the bad ones.
### 3. retool your plan.
> ### onion theory of risk.
If you’re an investor, you look at the risk around an investment
as if it’s an onion. Just like you peel an onion and remove each
layer in turn, risk in a startup investment comes in layers that
get peeled away — reduced — one by one.
#### What are the layers of risk for a high-tech startup?
1. `Founder risk` - does the startup have the right founding team? include a great technologist?,
Is the business person missing from the team altogether?
2. `Market risk` - Will anyone want it? Will
they pay for it? How much will they pay? How do we know?
3. `Competition risk` - Is this startup suZciently diWerentiated from the other startups, and also diWerentiated from any large incumbents?
4. `Timing risk` — is it too early? Is it too late?
5. `Financing risk` — after we invest in this round, how many additional rounds of financing will be required for the company to become proXtable, and what will the dollar total be? How certain are we about these estimates? How do we know?
6. `Marketing risk` — will this startup be able to cut through the noise? How much will marketing cost? Do the economics of customer acquisition — the cost to acquire a customer, and the revenue that customer will generate — work?
7. `Distribution risk` — does this startup need certain distribution partners to succeed? Will it be able to get them? How? (For example, this is a common problem with mobile startups that need deals with major mobile carriers to succeed.)
8. `Technology risk` — can the product be built? Does it involve rocket science — or an equivalent, like artiXcial intelligence or natural language processing? Are there fundamental breakthroughs that need to happen? If so, how certain are we that they will happen, or that this team will be able to make them?
9. `Product risk` — even assuming the product can in theory be built, can this team build it?
10. `Hiring risk` — what positions does the startup need to hire for in order to execute its plan? E.g. a startup planning to build a high- scale web service will need a VP of Operations — will the found- ing team be able to hire a good one?
11. `Location risk` — where is the startup located? Can it hire the right talent in that location? And will I as the VC need to drive more than 20 minutes in my Mercedes SLR McLaren to get there?
> put yourself in the VC’s shoes: what could this
startup do to minimize or eliminate enough of these risks to
make the company fundable?
### Some ideas on reducing risk
1. `Founder risk` - add one to more founder 
2. `Market risk` - you probably need to validate the market, at a practical level. Sometimes more detailed and analytical market research will solve the problem, but more oaen you actually need to go get some customers to demonstrate that the market exists. Preferably, paying customers. Or at least credible prospects who will talk to VCs to validate the market hypothesis.
3. `Competition risk` - Rethink this one from the ground up. If you don’t have a really solid idea as to how you’re dramatically diWerent from or advantaged over known and unknown competitors, you might not want to start a company in the Xrst place.
> Never, ever say your market projections indicate you’re
going to be hugely successful if you get only 2% of your
(extremely large) market.

> Never, ever say that you have no competitors. That signals
naivete. Great markets draw competitors, and so if you really
have no competition, you must not be in a great market.

4. `Timing risk` — the only thing to do here is to make more progress, and demonstrate that you’re not too early or too late. Getting customers in the bag is the most valuable thing you can do on this one.
5. `Financing risk` — rethink very carefully how much money you will need to raise aaer this round of Xnancing, and try to change the plan in plausible ways to require less money.
6. `Marketing risk` — First, make sure your differentiation is super sharp, because without that, you probably won’t be able to stand out from the noise.
> Then, model out your customer acquisition economics in detail
and make sure that you can show how you’ll get more revenue from a customer than it will cost in sales and marketing expense to acquire that customer. This is a common problem for startups pursuing the small business market,
7. `Distribution risk` - if your plan has distribution risk, which is to say you need a key distribution partner to make it work, personally I’d recommend shelving the plan and doing something else. Otherwise, you may need to go get the distribution deal before you can raise money, which is almost impossible. 
8. `Technology risk` — there’s only one way around this, which is to build the product
9. `Product risk` — same answer — build it.
10. `Hiring risk` - add it/them to the founding team. This will mean additional dilution for you, but it’s probably the only way to solve the problem
11. `Location risk` - move to where money is. You can start a company wherever you want, but you may not be able to get it funded there.
> #### further down the road — make more progress against your plan before you raise venture capital.

> The whole theory of venture capital is that VCs are investing in risk — another term for venture capital is “risk capital” — but the reality is that VCs will only take on so much risk, and the best thing you can do to optimize your chances of raising money is to take out risk.

> **Peel away at the onion.** -`So keep your options open all the way to the end`.

## "But I don't know any VCs!" - P3
> The starting point for raising money from VCs when you don’t know any VCs is to realize that VCs work mostly **through referrals**

### Now, on to developing contacts
> The best way to develop contacts with VCs, in my opinion, is to work at a venture-backed startup, kick butt, get promoted, and network the whole way.
0. join community or education relate to venture like MIT.
1. `Read VC blogs` — read them all, and read them very very care- fully. VCs who blog are doing entrepreneurs a huge service both in conveying highly useful information as well as frequently putting themselves out there to be contacted by entrepreneurs in various ways including email, comments, and even uploaded podcasts. Each VC is diWerent in terms of how she wants to engage with people online, but by all means read as many VC blogs as you can and interact with as many of them as you can in appropriate ways.
2. Create or contribute to a meaningful open source project. if you have
   time
