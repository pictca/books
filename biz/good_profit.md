KEY
## Start fast and already prepare material/resource 
The starting point was soliciting the producers business as soon as drilling was announced ( rather than waiting for the well to success). We also had a truck at the site ready to move the oil as soon as the
well began producting.
## BalanceSheet & Demonstrated make client confidence 
Another capability that gave us an advantage over our small
    competitors was we had a balance sheet that gave the producer the
    confidence tat we could always pay for the oil - and pay promptly
    even under adverse cicurmstances.Also we demonstrated we had the
    organization and systems to pay the right people, even on wells with
    complex owenership
# Pipeline ,Superior Operation System and Best Choice
Another key to our growth was developing the capability to build
pipelines and operate pipelines and trucks more economically than our
competitors.
This was **Good Profit 101: providing the best employees based on the opportunities we offered.**  
Our goal was and still is to be **to be the counterparty of choice to
our customers , vendors , communitities and employees.**
