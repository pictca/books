## Sandbox
The sandbox is where serious developers play. Practitioners are likely those
who have shepherded the automation candidate from a very rough idea
floating in hallway conversations to a tangible concept for value-added
application.
> creating a series of diagrams that thoroughly tell the story of this function: the motivation, the logic, the data sources, and the goal.
> Best practice suggests that developers save (commit) their project files as they are edited to a separate repository that maintains version history. GitHub is a popular service for this purpose.


## The Corporation as an Algorithm Factory
### Let me tell you the story of an algorithm “factory”.
- LeverJet is a company in the fractional jet business. 
- It is a fictitious composite of several companies I have worked with in the past. 
- LeverJet makes its money by offering flight hours on its fleet of private jets to corporate
executives and wealthy individuals who purchase a membership in one of
several plan offers. 
- The company owns about half the jets, the other half are part of a pooling arrangement with other aircraft owners. Similarly, a lengthy pilot roster lists individuals based all over the globe, each with a
unique set of certifications for various types of aircraft.
- LeverJet was founded by a professor of mathematics at a prominent university, who built the first formal scheduling simulation model of the frac- tional jet business. The model became the linchpin of the business plan that was pitched to an initial round of investors. Today LeverJet is one of the leading firms, but in an increasingly crowded market.

### suggested plan for a practitioner:
1. Navigate through the enterprise to discover algorithms wherever they lie
> The thought exercise that this one simple phrase brings to mind is often helpful as an organizing framework for capturing algorithms

2. Create a trackable inventory of algorithms
> A modern organization wouldn’t even think twice about keeping a list of all of the assets it owns, along with a constellation of meta-data about each asset

3. Prove (through models) that the algorithms generate business value

> The ROI models for the CFO ; These can and should be applied to individual algorithms to show their value.

> It must have in its make-up a model that self-reports its value. If the value is increasing or decreasing over time, this is a helpful metric to know, and might imply changes to the algorithm or altogether new algorithms needed in the mix.

4. Protect the company’s property rights to the algorithm
> You cannot patent anything that is abstract (like an algorithm), rather, you have to close the loop and pair that abstract thing with the actual application of the thing.
>
> As an example, an algorithm as a series of simple steps is not patentable, but when embedded into a machine that transforms some input to a different output, that combination is deemed patentable by the Bilski decision. It is a fine distinction that a good lawyer can advise. Short of a patent, however, there are many alternative ways to protect an algorithm:
- Store the algorithm securely with access both recorded and limited to certain individuals.
- Register it with a 3rd party, like a documented record with your law firm.
- Compile the code in such a way that the human-readable form cannot be reverse engineered easily.

5. Formally register the algorithm inventory with the company assets
