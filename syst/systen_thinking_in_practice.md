### PROCEDURE AND ADVICE
1. Define Analysis Aims
2. DEfine the Task/System under analysis
3. Data Collection
4. Transcribe Data
5. Construct Task Network
6. Conduct Social Network Analysis - Typically, the direction (i.e. from actor A to actor B) frequency, type and content of associations are recorded.
7. Construct Information Networks
- Following construction, information usage should be defined for each actor involved via shading of the information elements within the propositional networks.
8. Construct Composite Networks
- a task by agents network can be constructed by combining the task and social network to show which tasks are undertaken by which agents.
9. Analyse Networks - Involved using network metrics to anal- yse the task, social and information networks. This enables analysis of the structure of the networks and identification of key nodes
