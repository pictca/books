# What works to generate flows of new leads"
- Trial-and-Error in lead generation (requires patience,
  experimentation, money).
- "Marketing through teaching" via regular webinars, white papers, email
  newsletters and live events, to establish yourself as the trusted
  expert in your space (takes lots of times to build predictable
  momentum).
- Patience in building great word-of-mouth (the highest value lead
  generation source, but hardest to influence).
- Outbound Prospecting (aka "Cold Calling 2.0"):: By far the most
  predictable and controllable source of creating new pipeline, but it
  takes focus and expertise to do it well. Luckily, you are holding the
  guide to the process in your hands right now.
- Building an excited partner ecosystem (very high value, very long
  time-to-results).
- PR: It's great when, once in a while, it generates actual results!

The time-to-results adds up fast. There is the time spend on whether to
start a new program and what it is, then implementing it, generating
leads (hopefully!), then adding in your sale cycle length of time-just
to get your very first revenue deal closed.

## Start With More Awareness
Start with more awareness on how much pipeline you're generating:
- Do you executive team and board know much new (qualified) pipeline the
  company needs to generate per month? (This is the second most
  important metric to track, right after closed business)
- Is the "new pipeline generated per month" number tracked at the board
  level?
- Are there a common language, and common definitions, for "prospects,"
  "leads" and "opportunities"? One of the biggest problems is usually
  mis-communication and misunderstanding of terms and metrics between
  executives and directors.

At least if your executive team and board are aware of the pipeline gap -
the amount of pipeline required to hit your results, and likely places
it will come from - you can begin to be more realistic in both your goal
and plans to execute on those goals. You will also be less likely to
break trust with your team and investors by missing your goals as a
surprise, i.e., without really knowing why.

- "Failure" is just your judgment of an experience, because there are no
  failures - just learning opportunities.

## Key to the team's record of year - after-year-after year success:
- Predictable Results/ROI: We had a simple sales prospecting process
  that was highly effective, repeatable, and very predictable. Our
  process and training system made it easy for sales reps to succeed,
  and 95% of them exceeded their numbers while ramping up. After about
  12 month of results and data, we could predict the future results of
  new hires on my team. For example, I knew that if we hired someone
  costing $100,000 per year (including all their overhead), that person
  would generate as much $3,000,000 per year in total contracts. I could
  also predict how long it would take for that person to ramp up and
  become cash-flow positive to the company.
- Self-Managing Systems:
    Everything was a system. I didn't want myself or any single person
    to be a bottleneck to the success of the team. What if I was hit by
    bus? The team had to be self-managing so that it could grow and
    succeed.

Your sales results are only scalable to the extent the CEO and
executives are designed out of the process. Too many companies are
dependent on the CEO or VP Sales for selling. How can you make the sales
team and results independent of your direct help, except for coaching
them?
