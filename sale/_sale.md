#### Psychology Says You Can Actually Sell Anything, So Long as You Use These 4 'Hidden' Switches
> **1 .Solution Switch**.: Show that your product is the answer to their problems.People do not buy products. They buy solutions. And if you can convince your customers that your product is the solution to whatever problems they might be having, you'll spark their interest and turn on the most important switch necessary to making a sale.

> **2. Trust Switch: Become an authority figure**. Trust is a necessary component of making a sale, and whether it's consciously or subconsciously, all customers want to know that they're buying from a legitimate source. The key to flipping a customer's trust switch is to convince her that you're an authority figure--someone who is trusted as an expert on the subject at hand.

> **3. Likability Switch: Befriend your customer**. We resonate with those who share our beliefs and ideologies, and we have trouble relating to those who don't. Similarly, customers prefer to buy from people they like. It's the whole reason why PR nightmares like the BP oil spill and the United Airlines overbooking incident are always followed by a noticeable decline in business, and it's also why companies love to publicize their charitable acts of philanthropy.

> **Evidence Switch: Customers need proof, not promises**.People are often skeptical about whether or not they'll actually realize the benefits they hope to get from their purchase. It's this uncertainty that puts them on edge, as it can be very difficult to ascertain the quality and effectiveness of what you're trying to sell before actually making a purchase. In the back of their minds, customers are asking themselves a lot of questions: Will taking this marketing course really make me a master salesman and triple my income? Will buying this new outfit really impress all my friends? Will paying for this professional résumé writing service really double the number of interviews I get?
