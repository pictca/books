We're making open source software to collaborate on code. 
It started as 'run your own GitHub' that most users deploy on their own server(s).

GitLab allows you to version control code including pull/merge requests,
forking and public projects. It also includes projects wiki's and an
issue tracker. Over 100k organizations  use it including thousands of
programmers at Apple. We also offer GitLab CI that allows you to test
your code with a distributed set of workers.
