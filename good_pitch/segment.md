Segment helps companies give their customers a better customer
experience and we do that by helping them organize all of their internal
data about all their interactions with the customer. 

So for example if
you to the bank, they interact with you with you at the ATM, at the
teller via phone call center, they have a web app and mobile app, they
send a emails, they're interacting with you across this huge surface
area and they need to be able to coordinate that interaction right, they
need to know that if you encountered an error on the ATM, the teller
needs to be able to say like "I'm so sorry you encountered an error
about to be able to help you and so what we do is we help sort of bridge
that gap of having a single record of all those interaction with each
customers."
