We're making open source software to collaborate on raw data of medical into usable standard medical code.
Cisher allows the medical coder easier to do their jobs by optimizing search in medical code standards like ICD series, CPT, and HCPCS.
We also help automate auditing through our system for minimizing the occurrence and effects of human error on the processes.
