## Autonomous Checkout is now a reality 
: Standard Cognition's camera-only computer vision store launch.

We're super excited. We've been working, really, for the last couple of
years to deliver the future of shopping. And our belief is you should be
able to walk into any store in the world, grab what you want, walk out,
skip the line and just get your receipt. And to achieve that, you really
have to do two thing.
- Number one, you have to be able to take existing stores and transform them. We call that a retrofit. 

So can we deliver this new, amazing experience, autonomous checkout,
skipping the line, in existing store? That's step one.

And step two is, can you do this at scale?
Can you really show this as a repeatable process that you can take many
store and transform them? And we're really demonstrating both of those
things today. We're launching three stores where we're retrofitting
them. Shoppers can now shop, grap what they want, leave the store and
get their receipt automatically in all three locations. So we're
incredibly excited to show that this is a repeatable process that we can
take stores and transform them to give that amazing, new experience.
- We thought we knew what most of the challenges were when we were
  working to get our own store launched, a Standard Store here in SF.
  And yeah, a lot of amazing computer vision challenges, tracking being
  one of the biggest ones. How do you anonymously track people through
  multiple cameras as they go through their entire shopping trip? It's
  really something that's a state-of-the-art system that didn't really
  exist before we even started.

So that was an incredible challenges, and lots of other interesting
computer challenges as well. But what we've learned over the last couple
of years is even once you've got those basic building blocks in place,
integrating with that retail store, there are operations, there's SKUs,
the way that they do stocking, the way that their planograms work. It's
much more chaotic and much more challenging to meet the retailer where
they are when you can't actually reach across and say, hey, ley's maybe
change how this works, or change how this looks, or change how the shelf
is going to be displayed. You don't have those abilities anymore. And
you really just have to say, okay, completely hands off, let's meet the
retailer where they are, and just make this work.

So it was really interesting to cross that final chasm.
