Here are some of the biggest mistakes first time founder make when
starting their company and in the first year afterward.

1. I often see founders choosing to solve a problem that they actually
   don't care about - this mistake isn't fatal and while there are many
   many examples of founders who've learned to love their product or
   their problem at later date. One of the things that I do see is that
   a lot of startups that fail basically fail because they lose
   motivation to continue working on their company and a lot of that has
   to do with the fact that they actually didn't really like the problem
   they were working on in the beginning. They were trying to pick a
   problem that they thought people might want or they thought could
   grow quickly or they thought might be cool but it wasn't actually
   something they were willing to devote a significant in a out of time
