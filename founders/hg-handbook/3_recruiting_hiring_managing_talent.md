# Recruiting, hiring, and managing talent
10 Sep 2020

One of the biggest challenges a company faces as it scales is to revamp
its recruiting and employee onboarding processes. When Twitter bought my
startup it had just 90 employees. By the time I left two and half years
later, Twitter had grown to close to 1,500 people - 93% of the employees
were new.

In order to add 500 people a year you need to change the way you
approach and scale your recruiting organization, you need to think
deeply about employee onboarding, and you need to maintain and evolve
your culture. In this chapter we cover these and other shifts required
to hire and manage talents.

## Recruiting Best Practices
As you sale from hiring 10 people a year to 10 people a week, a small
number of recruiting processes can go a long way in maintaining a high
bar and expediting key hires.

## Write a Job Description For Every Role
Many companies start off recruiting via personal networks for a small
number of roles-e.g. engineers and designers. As a company scales beyond
individual contributors in a handful of functions, it is important for
people hiring for a role to understand what is important in the person
they hire. For example, if you are hiring a business development person
for the first time (see "how to hire great BD people"), what should
people look for in the person and role? And engineer on the interview
panel might not know the difference between a business development and a
sales person. Clarifying skill set and role is important so everyone is
looking for the same type of candidate.

For each role you should write a job description that explains what the
role will do, and what experience and background you are looking for.
You can also the list the things you are not looking for, or consider
less important. Tis description should be circulated to people
interviewing for the role with a short note explaining what the hiring
manager is looking for and prioritizing. If you team subsequently raises
questions about who to hire for the role, you can refer back to the
original job description to correct any bad assumptions.

## Ask Every Candidate the Same Questions
For each candidate for a given role, ask the same or similar interview
questions. This will allow you to calibrate candidates across identical
questions.

## Assign Focus Areas to Interviews Prior to the interview
Often you want to interview candidates for specific aspects of their
role. For example, you might interview a product manager on their
product insights, pas accomplishments, culture fit, etc. Rather than
have every person the candidate interviews with ask the same set of
questions for every area, you could have three of four interviewers each
focus on a different area that you assign to them before the interview.
This will allow for an in-depth view of each area, versus a shallow view
of all areas.

Additionally, if you bring the person back for a second round of
interviews, you can double down on areas of concern with more focused
interviews.

- "One of the biggest determinants of candidate conversion is how
  quickly you interview them and how quickly you can make an offer." -
  Elad Gil

## Work Product Interviews
For some roles, the best way to assess a candidate (outside of direct
prior knowledge working with them) is to have them develop a work
product as part of the interview. This could happen either onsite or as
a take home. for example, an engineer could do a coding exercise, or a
designer could be asked to do a quick set of wire frames or workflow for
a hypothetical product. A marketing person could be asked to generate a
hypothetical product marketing plan. In general, it is good to avoid
asking for work or output on an existing company product to avoid the
perception of getting free labor out of a candidate.

## Candidate Scoring
As each person finishes their interview, it is good for them to enter
feedback about the candidate before talking to other interviews. This
avoids people biasing each other and forcs each interviewer to take a
written stance on a candidate. You can also adopt a numeric ranking
system (e.g., 1-5 points) or a simple "hire, no hire" scale. The key is
consistency, as well as providing interviewers with a clear definition
of what these outputs should mean. Consistent scoring can allow you to
quickly reject or pursue candidates. In general, your scoring system
prevents interviewer from having the easy out of a "neutral" option.
Hence the "hire/no hire" framework would lack a "no opinion" option.

## Move Fast
Every company I have ever worked for, or with, has realized that one of
the biggest determinants of candidate conversion is how quickly you
interview them and how quickly you can make an offer. Beyond conversion,
a key metric to track is how long candidates spend in each step and for
rapidly getting offers out.

## Check Candidates' References
Reference checks are often the clearest signal on a candidate. You
should referencecheck everyone. Be careful with business people-they
tend to provide friends in their organization as references, and in
general will get glowing recommendations from their friends. I have
found engineering and other functions to be more direct/honest when
providing references for their friends. To compensate for this, try to
broaden the scope of references you check for business people to other
functions to ensure clarity of their skills and areas for improvement

## Diverse Candidates
Ensuring diversity (of gender, race or ethnic background, sexual
orientation, social class and background and more) in your employee base
and interview process is the subject of numerous books and blogs. One
excellent resource for this is Joelle Emerson's Paradigm Strategy
website, whose focus is diverse hiring practices.

You can also read the interview with Joelle later on in this book.
There is a lot of detail and nuance in getting to a diverse workforce. A
few key items:

 - 1. Ensure that you have diverse candidates for each role.
    You will never have a diverse employee base if you do not ensure
    diverse candidates in your funnel. Building a diverse funnel means
    not only sourcing a broader spectrum of candidates, but also
    thinking through the language in your job descriptions, how
    employees are represented on your website, and other factors that
    will impact who applies.

 - 2. Focus on eliminating biases from your interview approach.
    A number of biases exist in standard interviewing approaches. A
    simple example would be whether the names and gender of candidates
    is blinded at the resume review stage.

 - 3. Provide benefits that support the needs of underrepresented
      employees.
        Paid parental leave is one simple example. Think through your
        broader potential employee pool and what benefits would support
        their ability to focus on their work at your company.
For a more in-depth resource, I recommend you read a white paper from
Paradigm.

## Scaling A Recruiting Organization
The use of recruiter by a startup will shift dramatically over the
lifetime of the company.
As a small startup (e.g., 3-10 people), using a recruiter is usually not
as useful as direct founder or employee networking, using Linkedin and
other tools. In contrast, when I was at Twitter, the company grew from
~90 to ~1,500 people over a 2.5 year period. As your company scales into
the hundreds and thousands of people, you will want to bring specialized
recruiters, sourcers, unitversity programs managers, etc. In-house and
potentially use retained external recruiters for executive hires.

## Early Days: Your Team as Recruiters
Early on, the best approach to recruiting is to have people on your team
actively refer in people from their network. Similarly many founders %
early employees spend as much as 30-50% of their time early on (e.g.,
when scaling from 3 to 15 people) on recruiting. There is no easy fix
around it. You need to just grind through large numbers of people (via
networking, LinkedIn, friends, etc.) to find the handful of people to
join your team.

Some startups I know successfully hire someone who is a mix of office
manager/social media manager/recruiting coordinator. This person will
often spend a lot of time scheduling referred candidates and reaching
out to passive candidates via email and LinkedIn. Once the candidate
expresses interest they pass them off to a founder or hiring manager.

## Initial Scaling: The In-House Recruiter
Once a company hits a certain scale and is growing fast enough (adding
15-20 people per year or more), hiring in-house recruiters makes a lot
of sense. The recruiters initially plays a few different roles that in
larger stage companies will get split up including
 - Sourcing.
 - Running the recruiting process (scheduling, collating feedback,
   coordinating with hiring manager etc.).
 - in some case delivering offers (although I think often hiring
   managers or founders can do this).

Depending on the strength of the recruiter(and, importantly, the company
branding with your candidates), the recruiter will be able to hire 1-4
engineers per month. This shifts as the company scales and add more
differentiated roles (see below).

- "The importance of the hiring manager and other executives being
  involved in the recruiting process cannot be over emphasized." - Elad
  Gil

This means that if you are hiring fewer then 15 engineers a year, you
may want to have a part-time or split-role recruiter, grow organically
via company referrals, or find an alternative structure with external
recruiters.

For non-engineering roles (e.g. sales) a single recruiter may be able to
hire a larger number of people per month. This is driven in part by the
referral-heavy nature of sales hiring as well as the fact that there are
fewer high-growth companies for sales, marketing and business
development people to go to. In contrast, every startup is trying to
hire engineers and designers.

Things that impact the ability of the recruiter to be effective include:
 - Brand of the startup with candidates.
 - Strength of the hiring manager and executive team as recruiters. If
   they are active and engaged, it makes recruiting run smoother and
   will help to source and close more candidates.
 - Breadth of network of the employees at the company.

The importance of the hiring manager and other executuves being involved
in the recruiting process(through informal conversations, extending
offers, meeting for lunch, etc.) cannot be over-emphasized not matter
how strong a recruiting org you have. The candidates will always want
exposure to people in key roles in the company(Mark Zuckerberg at
Facebook is famost for his "closing walks" with mid-level candidates.)

## Hihg-Growth: Multiple Recruiting ORG Roles
When a company is growing really fast, the set of roles on the
recruiting team tends to fragment and you need to start specialize the
type of people on your recruiting team.

### Sources.
 Sourcers research, cold call, email, and otherwise create a path to
 passive candidates. In some cases they then transfer the candidates
 over to recruiters who will feed the candidate into a coordinated
 interview process. Some sourcers manage candidates up through an onsite
 interview, but seldom beyond.

### Recruiters.
 Recruiters manage the process of coordination of the candidate through
 scheduling various interviews (phone screens, onsite, executive, etc.)
 and the circling with the team or hiring manager to determine whether
 an offer will be extended. At some companies the recruiter may extend
 the offer, in other the hiring manager does so.

Your first few in-house recruiters should have experience sourcing as
well. This helps in a number of ways:
 - The recruiter will likely be more effective in sourcing and
   recruiting specialized engineering roles.
 - There will be fewer hand offs between people on the team (e.g.
   sourcer, recruiter, hiring manager, etc.) which means less friction
   on the candidate and fewer people fall through the cracks.

Splitting the recruiter and sourcer roles tends to work best when you
are hiring large number of people of a specific type.
For example, if you need to hire 50 backend engineers, 30 frontend
engineers, and 20 PM, starting to segment recruiting roles makes a big
difference.

 - 3. Candidate researchers.
    These people may scrub Linkedln for all the engineers at Google,
    orioritize them, put them into a spreadsheet, and then hand off the
    spreadsheet to the sourcers to actually do the outreach/pitch the
    candidates to interview.
   These people usually only really get added to the team as it scales
   from 100+ to 1,000+ people, and you are hiring large numbers of
   people in the same role.
 - 4. Recruiting marketing.
    These are the folks who develop marketing materials, run ads,
    organize recruiting events, hackathons, website content, etc. to
    create an inbound pipeline of candidates. At a startup, this is
    ususally driven by someone on the team you are recruiting for (e.g.
    an engineering manager for engineering candidates).

    Alternatively, the marketing team at the startup may be responsible
    for this as part of their overall marketing efforts. Only as a
    company scales to a few hundred people or more does the possibility
    of a standalone coordinating recruiting marketing role emerge.

 - 5. University programs.
    Given the specific timing and cadence of new graduate and intern
    hiring, some companies will specialize sourcers and recruiters
    specifically for coordination an hiring of new grads. When your
    startup is still small, instead of hiring dedicated university
    programs people, you can have your existing recruiting staff pivot
    to cover this area for the few months when it is most relevant.

## EXECUTIVE HIRES: RETAINED RECRUITER
For executive hires, a retained search  using an executive recruiting
firm may work well. While you will continue to mine your investors and
employees for leads, specialized recruiting firms have networks tailored
to fill your general counsel, CFO, or other role that may simply be
outside of your founder network.

For a retained search, you may pay an external recruiter some upfront
fee or retainer to find candidates for you. In general, these sorts of
searches work best if you are hiring an executive for the company versus
an individual contributor.
One reason is that executive hires may be outside of your core network,
or that executives may be more willing to talk to recruiters from a
brand-name firm than to someone from a less well-known startup.

There are a number of brand-name executive recruiters your angels, VCs,
or advisors can connect you to.

### EMPLOYEE ONBOARDING
Many companies make the mistake of spending months building a pipeline
for recruiting the very best people, but then spend little time actually
onboarding them to make sure they are successful.

Here are some simple ideas your office manager or head of people can try
as you onboard new people.
#### Send out a Welcome Letter
Send a welcome letter to the new employee-and cc all the teams that
person will be working with closely. The letter will explain the person,
their role, who they will report to, what their goals are for the
quarter, as well as potentially one interesting fact about them they are
willing to share. The idea is to ensure each new person has a clear role
and responsibilities, and that the rest of the organization is aware of
these things. The interesting fact creates an ice breaker for their
coworkers to be able to start a conversation with the new hire.

#### Welcome Package
Create a checklist of item that each new person receives as they show up
for their first day at the company. This should extend beyond the
utilitarian items of laptop and email address. Include a book on
management the company aspires to emulate, a T-shirt or hoodie, and if
they have a newborn leave them a onesie. You can also have a handwritten
(or sign) note welcoming the individual to the company.
#### Buddy System
High-growth companies tends to have thier own jargon, internal tools,
and random processes that are unique to them. Pair a new hire with a
"buddy"-someone who is not in the reporting chain of command with them
who can take them to lunch, introduce them to people, and importantly
answer any "stupid" questions they may have. Buddies tend be paired for
one to three months.
#### Make sure They Have Real OwnerShip
The biggest obstacles to happy employee onboarding tend to be (1) a bad
manager/employee relationship, and 
(2) a lack of feeling of ownership for the area they were hired to do.
The prior owner of a project may linger longer then is needed in order
to get credit for the prior work done.

Acknowledge their work but ramp them down as quickly as is reasonable so
the new employee can find their legs. If it is a short time window (two
week to launch) you can have the original owner launch the product or do
the work. If it is a longer timeframe (two months) you should transition
the project.

#### Set Goals
Each manager can set 30-, 60 and 90- day goals for new employees. This
gives a sense of direction, context, and structure for the new employee.
It also emphasizes what is important to get done and that individual's
priorities.

#### Old-Timer Syndrome and Early Employees
Some of the most valuable long-term employees of high-growth company
join early on. These employees often have earned the trust and
admiration of the founders and CEO, and they have the cultural context
and long-term mission of the company in mind, which enables them to
achieve outsized things in a high-growth startup. Examples like Susan
Wojciki(Google employee #16 and eventual CEO of Youtube) and Google and
Chris Cox at Facebook (who joined as an engineer in 2005 and is now
chief product officer come to mind.

Unfortunately, some early employees also dramatically overstay their
optimal tenure at a company as it scales. They may have gotten too rich
and lost their hunger, or simply not scaled their skill set and mindset
along with the company. Some cling to the past when they had lunch every
day with the CEO and had input into every company decision.

#### Early Employees That Scale
Early employees that can grow and scale responsibilities within a
company are invaluable. They can channel the mindset of founders/CEO
(and therefore get quick buy-in for their teams), have the trust of the
executive team and their peers, understand internal processes and
jargon, and have a deep understanding of the company operating
procedures and culture.

Their "old timer" status allows them to challenge convention (or provide
context on it) in ways that enable them to reshape or remove rules or
old processes.

While many early employees may lack deep functional or industry
expertise, the trust of the CEO allows them to hire, manage, and learn
from more experienced industry executives. Early employees who are
humble enough to realize they can learn from fresh blood can grow with
the company and use it as a personal platform for their own learning and
impact. Some early employees will stick with a breakout company for
decades and their personal story arc mirrors that of the company. These
employee tend to be hungry to learn from others, understand that the
company, their role, and its culture will inevitably evolve, and are
open to change.

A common sign that an old-timer will work out is their eventual
acceptance that their role and influence at the company will shrink in
the short- to medium-term as the tam scales, but that it will expand
with time as they continue to learn and the company continues to scale.

#### Old-Timers what should move on
In contrast to the early employees that scale, there are also a set of
old-timers that should probably change role, quit, or be managed out.
Often the temptation is to keep giving early employees chances or to
move them to a spot that they are not hyper productive but is "less
important." Usually this suggests that the fit between the employee and
the company is not a good one. Often the employee will be happier to
leave the company but feels obligated to stick it out due to loyalty to
founders or the company.

When dealing with an early employee who is failing to grow with company,
you can take the following steps:
 - 1. Identify the problem and whether it is solvable. Potential issues
      may inculde:
     - Does not evolve with the company.
        Some early employees fight cultural organizational,  product, or
        other changes to the company. They may fight against the hiring
        of a sales team, the professionalization of staff, or the sun
        setting of an increasingly irrelevant product or strategy.
     - Cannot scale into the role they want.
     Early employees are often the first or only person in their
     functional area. Your first marketing person may not be the right
     long term VP marketing, and your first engineer may not make sense
     as your CTO. Individuals may lack the skill set, experience, or
     maturity for certain roles. Given their early tenure at the company
     employeess may nonetheless ask for roles that are beyond their
     capabilities. Founder CEOs will often put up with poor functional
     or team leads who cannot scale, but who have deep founder
     relationships and trust.
     - Feeling left out.
        When the company was 12 people the early employee had lunch
        with the founders every day and had the chance to give her
        opinion on all major company decisions. As a company scales,
        most early employees no loger have as strong of a voice or
        influence. Some of them may start to act out by blocking new
        projects or inappropriately escalating to founders they still
        have relationships with.
     - Inappropriate exertion of power.
        Some early employees or founders may have a large title as a
        historical artifact but little unfluence. The person who was CTO
        at 10 people may still be CTO at 1,000 people, despite not
        having any reports or real responsibilities. This is even
        stronger with cofoudners, who will have strong influence at a
        startup whether they are still active with the company or not.
        Some cofounders or people with fancy titles may lobby or push
        parts of the company to do things they want even if they are not
        supposed to. Often the other employees do not realize the
        cofoudner or titled employee is acting out of band with the rest
        of the executive team.
      - Getting too rich.
        Due to secondary stock sales and tender offers it is possible to
        partically cash out. Some employees may suddenly be liquid to
        the tune of tens of millions of dollars and get distracted by
        travel, buying houses, and cars ,or other issues.

- "Early employees who are humble enough to realize they can learn from
  fresh blood can grow with the company and use it as a personal
  platform for their own learning and impact." - Elad Gill.

 - 2. Put emotion aside and understand if there is a problem.
    As a founder CEO you will feel you owe the early employees for their
    early work and dedication. People may come to you with issues around
    a person that you will ignore or defer. This will create a bad
    environment for everyone including the early employee. It is best to
    understand the situation and the act quickly and decisively.
 - 3. Address the issue head on.
    As a first step, you should discuss the issues with the early
    employee. Sometimes the issues are addressable and the frank
    conversation with the employee turns things around. If there is a
    fundamental mismatch between the role they have and their skills, it
    is best to move them to a place of good fit. This may lead to a
    demotion and the departure of the employee. It is okay to discuss
    this frankly and explain why you are making the change, and whether
    they will be happy or thrive with it. As an early employee they are
    likely a large equity holder in the business and should act with you
    to maximize equity value. Often, CEOs try to find early employees a
    place where they won't do much harm, vwesus a place they will excel.
    If you find yourself thinking this way, 99% of the time the right
    answer is to part ways with the early employee. You can let them go
    with grace and they may be relieved to be free to do something new.
