## What do product managers do?
At a high level, a product manager (PM) is the single cross-functional
owner directly responsible for the success of a product - CEO of the
product - they have all the responsibility for the product's success but
often lack the direct line reporting of the other functions.

Product managers are responsible for:
 - 1. Product strategy and vision
    The product strategy and vision should also reflect the voice of the
    customer. The product manager should be on top of incorporating user
    input and feedback into the product lifecycle.
 - 2. Product prioritization & problem solving
    They "own" the product road map and are responsible for ensuring it
    has the right set of trade-offs on features versus impack and work
    needed.
    They will also spend time problem-solving aspects of the product or
    its development.
    Note: product managers will not work on this alone
 - 3. Execution: timelines, resources, and removal of obstacles.
    (a) lobbying for resources or attention from engineering, design,
    and other functions.
    (b) removing or priioritizing features and providing a clear road
    map for execution.
    (c) asking "stupid" questions to see if it is possible for each
    function to reduce timelines or remove unneeded features or work.
    (d) pushing back on extraneous requests, whether those are internal
    (design, sale, etc.) or external (customers, partners).

It about to maintenance, feature iteration and eventually the sunsetting
or killing of a product. Deprecating a product can be art in its own
right as your transition customers off, deal with pricing changes, or
other issues that may cause customer backlash.
    * Product managers != Project managers - i.e. a PM's primary job is
      not just running a schedule.

 - 4. Communication and coordination (overlays all of the above).
    Ask "Why?" behind the product road  map, priioritizing, and
    sequencing. Part of this will be creating a framework that
    establishes why some things are prioritized higher than others-and
    it's important that all other functions buy into this framework.
    With the closely collaborrate and tension with, Engineer will be
    feel that since they are building everything and they should have
    the power to make product decisions. Design will think PM is
    redundant with design and sales will wonder why product can't ship
    faster and why the PM is always trying to keep sales people away
    from engineers (it's about focus on do the things that matter -
    build product)

    PM should also function as the "buffer" or shield that protects
    engineers and designers from other internal and external parties.
    Sales and marketing people will always want to meet engineers
    directly to lobby for their favorite features, while customers will
    want to have a conversation directly with engineering. PM should be
    a smart buffer for these interactions and consolidate all input and
    qa into weekly interal team meeting, or can act as the primary point
    of contact for sales - for prevent and protect engineers and
    designers time. 
    The best way to convince an engineers of a customer need is to put
    her in front of a customer. Hearing customer feedback first-hand can
    often change minds or shape a great brainstorm or problem-solving
    session.

## Do you have the right people?
 Here some checklist:
 (i) have a weak engineering management counterpart they are covering
 for,
 (ii) are not empowered to do their job by company management.
 (iii) do not understand their job
 (iv) are not respected by their peers and cannot do more important
 work.
    Most of time of PM should be going towards definds the product,
    priioritizing trade-offs, spending time with customers, and working
    with various functions on launch, feature iteration, and
    communication.
    The hartest part may be to spearate whether the right person is in
    the right role versus whether your company is empowering that person
    properly.

## Characteristics of great product managers
 1. Product taste.
    have the insights and intuition to  understand customer needs for a
    product in a given area.
    What product features will wow a customer or meet their core needs?
 2. Ability to prioritize.
    - Value of a poposed product feature versus the engineers work
      needed to accomplish it?, What more important- new product for
      sales or feature for customers?
      Priceing should be optimized for customers or business owners?
      What is the 80% product that should be launched immeditely and
      what singular customer problem does it solve?
 3. Ability to execute.
    Build , maintain and support
 4. Strategic sensibilities.
    How industry landscape evolving?
    How can the product be positioned to make an end run around the
    competition?
 5. Top 10% communication skills.
 6. Metrics and data-driven approach.
## Empowering the VP product
 - Delegate aspects of product strategy and planning to the VP product
    Delegation doesn't mean addication, Rather, They should work with
    cross-functional teams to generate a product road map and
    prioritization that is then blessed/modified by the CEO.
 - Empower and support the VP product.
    They may
        - implement set to basic new procesess in company.
        - turn over or re-organize a subset of their team just as any
          new executive would.
        - crave out a strong role for product management than existed
          traidionally once.
        - VP product will need the CEO's support to make these changes.
 - Be patient.
 
## Product Management Process
The keys include:
 1. PRD templates and product road maps
    - getting agreement and clarity on what to build. While engineering
      owns writing the technical design docuementation for how a product
      will be technically architected and work, PM should own writing up
      the set of requirements for the product itself. Who are you
      buildin this product for? What use cases does the product meet?
      What does it solve for and explicitly not solve for? What are the
      main features and what does the product do? What are the main
      product dependencies?
      A PRD may include wireframes that roughly sketch out the product
      user journey.
 2. Product reviews
    Many companies have a weekly product review meeting. That will be
    given product and provide feedback on strategy, direction or launch
    readiness. A set of product teams will come in and present to these
    executives about their product development or road map.
    - baseline discussion on primary objectives, use cases and road
      maps or focus the meeting on check-ins for major products already
      underway.
    Product reviews may also be used to check in on post-launch metrics
    or success of the product or check in on user feedback or adoption.

 3. Launch process and calendar
    As you scale and the number of projects skyrockets, having a
    stand-alone forum to discuss upcoming launches becomes useful. or
    may be have internal web page where each product is listed with a
    launch date. Next to each project, each functional area can give a
    binary "ready to launch" or not, and add questions or issues from
    their function. should be tag when unsolved certain issue like "legal" that allow the executive team work with understand the problems.

 4. Retrospectives
    After each product launch a healthy practice is to get the main
    cross-functional members of the team who worked on it together.
    Retrospectives serve two purposes
    - 1. To codify and understand what best practices and for product
         development and launch and 
    - 2. To allow some of the praise, as well as pressure and
         disagreements to vent in the open. By having a forum for
         non-emotional conversations around what went poorly, different
         teams have the oppotunity to learn what to do better next time,
         but also to address questions or things that not work head on.

## Product Management conversion and training
Before considering the conversion of a non-PM into a PM role, you should
optimally have

- 1. An interview or trial process to check if someone should convert,
- 2. Core product management processes in place so the new PM will have
     guardrails on how to function
- 3. A VP product in place to manage the individual and ensure they are
     trained, and 
- 4. Some seasoned senior PMs in place to mentor and support the
     development of the new PM. Just as your company provides some
     onboarding and mentorship to junior or new sale people or
     engineers, the same is useful for product.

     "For all hire referencechecking is incredibly important." - Elad
     Gil

At many high-growth startups, there is a common pattern for early
product team evolution. This pattern is most common at startups where
the founders did not have work experience at a major technology company
before starting their own:

 - The CEO or one of the founders is playing the role of product
   manager. As the company balloons they delegate to other employees
   already in place to take on product management. This may lead to the
   conversion of designers, business operations, marketers, engineers,
   or others into early product managers.
 - With a lack of product management process and infrastructure in place
   and no senior PMs around, these individuals are left to fend for
   themselves. Some may default to playing management role versus a
   product role. For example, their time may get spent on execution and
   checklists versus setting product vision and road maps or
   troubleshooting cross-functional issues. This may lead to ongoing
   discounting of the role in product in the organization until a more
   experienced organization is built.

- A VP product is hired, restarts the product team, sets processes, and
  the company integrates product management in as its own discipline.
  .It may take a year or more to recruit and empower senior PMs and to
  reshape organizational processes to scale the function and its impact
  internally.

Google is a good example of a company that experienced tis pattern.
Among the first product managers at Google were conversions such as
Marissa Mayer(a former engineer), Susan Wojcicki(marketing), Grorges
Harik(engineer) and Salar Kamander(general operations). These four were
complemented by some senior product management hires and Jonathan
Rosenberg and experienced VP product who came in and established a
number of processes. Rosenberg also implemented a hiring and training
program for new grads(the famous Google APM program). Rosenberg was a
necessary component to bring stability and best practices to Google
product development.

## Product to Distribution Mindset
Startups tend to succeed by building a product that is so compelling and
differentiated that it causes large number of customer base becomes a
major asset for the company going forward. Products can be cross-sold to
these customers, and the company's share of time or wallet can expand.

Since focusing on product is what caused initial success, founders of
breakout companies often think product development is their primary
competency and asset. In reality, the distribution channel and customer
base derived from their fist product is now one of the biggest
go-forward advantages and differentiators the company has.

This pattern of distribution as moat and competitive advantage was used
ruthlessly by the prior generation of technology companies. Microsoft
bought or built multiple franchise including Office (Word, Powerpoint,
Excel were all stand-alone companies or market segments), Internet
Explorer, and other products and then pushed them down common business
and consumer channels. Cisco has purchased dozens of companies that were
then repositioned or resold to their enterprise and telecom channels.
SAP and Oracle have exhibited similar patterns of success.

Of the most recent crop of technology ginats, Facebook and Ggogle
realized the power and importance of distribution early in their
respective lives. While Google's reputation is that of organic growth,
in reality the company bought placement on the Firefox homepage, as
well as paid hundreds of millions of dollars per year to have Google search toolbars distributed via download with other applications and also paid laptop manufacturers to set Google as the default search engine. Google then used its search customer base to bootstrap other products and distribute Maps (Where2 acquisition) Gmail, Chrome, Doc (Writely and other acquisitions), and other products. Similarly, Facebook invested heavily in growth efforts and acquired multiple companies for email scraping to be able to find people you should invite to the service (Octazen), low end feature phone distribution (the Sanptu acquisition allowed Facebook to acquire 100 million feature phone users onto its platfor who they would not have gotten on the desktop alone), and other approaches. It then used this distribution to help accelerate acquisitions like Instagram to the global market.

In all cases, the steps to success have been:
 1. Build a products so good that customers will use you over an
    incumbent.
    Build a large user base on the back of this first product.
 2. Be aggressive rather than complacent about customer growth early.
    Outsized companies like Google, Facebook, and Uber were aggressive
    and calculatin about growth from their earliest days. In contrast,
    non-metric-driven, less agressive companies failed to reach the next
    level of success. Too many companies get complacent about
    distribution if their core product "just works."
 3. Realize your customer channels are a primary asset of the company.
    Build new products or buy companies and push them down your sales
    channel. Uber has been trying to do this more recently with Uber
    Eats and its Jump acquisition.
 4. Realize that your company will not be able to build everything
    itself.
    Buy more companies and push them down the channel. Most companies
    need to overcome internal resistance to buying companies. A common
    set of arguments are made about how easy it would be to build
    something in house instead, or that integration challenges will be
    too hard. In reality, breakout companies never have enough resources
    to do everything and should buy more startups. In general, nost
    companies buy too few, rater than too many, companies as they scale.
    
    The smartest companies realize they are also in the distribution
    business, and will buy (or build) and then redistribute a range of
    products.
