## Insight
## An unauthorized guide

First of all, I'm really excited to be working with each of you and your
teams.
### Operating approach
- Bi-weekly or weekly 1:1s. We'll try to keep the times consistent so
  you can plan. I'm  a big fan of a joint 1:1 doc to track our agendas,
  actions, goals, and updates.

- Weekly team meetings, as appropriate-I view these as both update and
  decision-making/work review forums. I expect people to be prepared and
  to participate, even though we'll have to manage video conferences and
  time zones.

- Quarterly planning sessions-it's my hope we make these happen with
  strong pre-work and good follow-up afterward with our teams and
  partners (internal or external).

- It's possible that we'll have some Stripe separate business
  review-type meetings and we can work hard to keep work manageable
  between these and planning sessions. Stay tuned.

- Speaking of 1:1s
    - We'll do a career session at some point in our first few months of
      working togethe-your history, why you've made choices you have
      made, what oyour ambitions are for the future, etc. These help me
      know where you are in terms of personal development interests and
      ambitions with respect to longer-term plans.
    - Personal goals-I believe in the two of us reviewing the top 3-5
      personal goals you have each quarter or so (these are the things
      that you personally spend your time on, not your team plans, which
      I know you also spend time on...). We can discuss them each Q and
      then mark out a plan on how we make sure you get time. space, and
      support to accomplish what you need. I do these every 3-6 months
      and will shared mine with everyone, also.

- Your teams
    - Please add me to emails (fwd as FYI or add me) or documents that
      might be helpful for me to see as a way to understand the team and
      day-to-day work.
    - As work is ongoing or a team member does a great job on something,
      forward it or link from our 1:1 doc. I like to see WIP and I am
      happy to meet with folks who have done great work so they can walk
      me through it-your discretion.
    - Finally, I look forward to personally meeting everyone on your
      team and let's keep an eye to make sure I've done that over the
      next few months.

### Manager Handbook
Collaborative
 - I'm very collaborative which means I like to discuss decisions and
   options and whiteboard big stuff in a group. I will rarely get stuck
   in one position or opinion but the downside is that you won't always
   get a quick judgment out of me-I need to talk it through and see some
   idea/data/options. Due to this bias, I can sometimes be slow to
   decide and if you need a decision quickly, make sure I know it.

Hands-off
 - I'm not a micro-manager and I won't sweat your details *unless* I
   think things are off track and if I do, I'll tell you my concern and
   we can work together to make sure I understand and plan together on
   how to communicate better or right the situation. That said, when I
   am new to a project/team I often get into the work alongside people
   so I can be a better leader-I will get involved in details and be
   more hands-on early on in a new initiative and just be warned on
   that. It's how I will know how to help if you need me later.
 - I expect you are making decisions a lot without me and if you come to
   me I'll usually put it back on you with, "What do you want to do?" or
   "What should you do?" and just help you decide. That said, if there
   is a big one brewing, I'd love to know about it and I'm always here
   to talk it out. I like to know what's going on with you and your
   team.

Accountable and organized
 - I take action items really seriously and I expect you to know what
   yours are, when they are due, and get them done. I don't like chasing
   them but I do notice when things slip-it's fine to renegotiate
   deadlines but I'll be annoyed if it's the day after the deadline...
 - I dislike being caught last-minute with people working hard on
   something we could have gotten ahead of-please help anticipate big
   work efforts and let's be in front of them together. Similarly, I
   want us to be ruthless in priorities while we are
   resource-constrained. I need you all sane...and me too.

Data-driven
 - I like data and dashboards so there is one, objective (ideally) way
   to measure progress and results but I dislike being bogged down in
   data and torturing the numbers. Let's review consistent information
   on what really matters and use data to get insight, not to lull
   ourselves into thinking we know what's going on or to try to find
   answers that might involve going with our gut.
 - I also like to make agreements on "how we do things" that we then
   agree to vary/make exceptions on as a group versus everyone inventing
   their own process/frameworks.
 - If we're discussing something and you know of or can imagine data
   that would be useful to our decision, bring it up(See below-sometimes
   I go into intuitive mode and I should be analyzing first.)

#### But intuitive?!
 - I'm also intuitive about people, products, and decisions which means
   I'm happy to handle situations when I don't have a lot of facts or
   data. You're thinking uh-oh, she's going to jump to conclusions, but
   I've worked hard in my career not to be that person. Ultimately, I
   think I have a good gut but I'm not wedded to it.
   "Your" job is to get my sense of something and argue it out with me.
   I love a good fight to a better outcome.
 - I use my intuition a lot with talent management and I've been told I
   am a good "read" on people. Again, I work hard not to judge or jump
   to conclusions but I will put forward hypotheses about your team
   members and your job is to make sure I really know the people.
 - I always like to know what's going on personally with people so I can
   see the whole picture. I am a believer that we are "whole selves,"
   not work selves and home selves and it will help me know you and your
   team better if I know context. If something hard is going on
   personally with people so I can see the whole picture. I am a
   believer that we are "whole selves," not work selves and home selves
   and it will help me know you and your team better if I know context.
   If something hard is going on with someone on your team, I'd love to
   know and be there to support you/them.

#### Strategic
 - I try to think about where things will end up and the straightest
   line to get there but I'm pretty flexible along the way. If there is
   swirl I usually think to myself: "What's the big lever here?" "What
   problem are we trying to solve?" "What do we need to solve it?" "What
   information do we need and when will we get it?" and I expect you to
   do the same. Every day I try to think about what's the most important
   thing I can do and do that above all else. But sometimes  I get
   buried under email and fail!

By the way, I am often overly generous with my time and say yes too
often to things. If you see this, please flag it to me. Although I love
meeting with people, I sometimes don't spend enough time on the
strategic stuff because I am working on other things. Help keep me
honest.

#### User oriented
 - I put this last because I think of my key leverage as more about
   scale than individual customer work, but I'm always interested in
   sales status, customer issues, customer stories, and meetings with
   users, especially when I'm traveling.

### Communication
1:1s
 - Use 1:1s for items better discussed verbally and items that can wait
   for our weekly check-in. Email takes a "ton" of time, so use it
   wisely.
 - If we don't have a 1:1 for a while, feel free to email or ping, of
   course.

### Email
 - I read fast but I have slight carpal tunnel in my left arm and I
   don't love writing super long emails, ore do I think they're very
   productive, although watch me break this rule on occasion!
 - I will read every email I get in a day but I don't respond if you ask
   me something directly or I have a question. Thus, assume I did rad
   the email within 18 hours, but if you think I owe you a response
   please resend or ping me and I won't be offended.
 - I "love" fyi emails when you send me something you saw, a customer
   anecdote, and article, some data, or something someone on your team
   did and if you write fyi in the subject or in the fwd I'll know it's
   for my information but "not" requiring response or urgent reading and
   I'll do the same for you. FYI = no response required.

 - If you add me to a team email celebrating something that I somehow
missed, I know that's the signal to weigh in usually with "yay!", so go
ahead but don't overuse it or in my experience people will think it's
meaningless.

### Chat/ping
 - If it's urgent/impt/timely or super short feel free to ping any
   time, even when I am "red."
 - Short questions on ping are fine but I might be inconsistent in
   response times since I am often in meetings.
 - If it's a long topic and not time sensitive, maybe just wait for our
   1:1.

Overall, I like more communication rather than less and I like to know
what's going on with you and your team and that helps me do a better job
for you. I don't view that as micromanagement but if you feel like I am
too much in the weeds, please tell me. 
Finally, I don't believe I will create a lot of email volume and I'll be
the first to recommend we do a quick in-person sync to resolve something
versus a long email exchange. Or better yet, you can be the first to
recommend it, and I'll be the second.

I also like plans that are documented. I don't care if it's slides or
docs or spreadsheets but I expect detailed work has been done when
needed and if you have WIP or plans, I love to be included early and
often in their development "but" I'll generally only weigh in when asked
or on final review, even if I have draft access.

  - I like a good laugh and to have fun with the people I work with.

### Feedback
I like it. I like to give it and I like to receive it, particularly
constructive. We're in this to get better together. We'll have a
quarterly official session but O try to be timely when I observe or hear
something and please do the same. I also like to know how and what your
team is thinking and feeling and I will do skip levels, office hours,
etc. Remember, whatever I hear or see, I have your back and I'll tell
you when I'm concerned. Anyone who vents to me about you s going to get
my help to tell you directly.

### Management and people
I care a lot about you, your people, and all of your development. Please
make sure we're touching base on your team, building our teams' skills
as individuals and as teams constantly, and that I know when there are
superstars and challenges so we can help people together.

### Results
Let's get good ones and know we did.
Measure measure measure :)

### Humor
Finally, I like a good laugh and to have fun with the people I work
with.
Hope this was helpful and, again, I look forward to working together.
You are all welcome to add to this document and make it a little more
"authorized!" :)

## THE CHANGING COFOUNDER DYNAMIC
If you have multiple co-founders, one of the biggest executive
transitions that will happen is a change of influence and role for one
or more of your co-founders. At many early startups multiple co-founders
weigh in on every decision. As a company grows you will need to define
the boundaries of decision-making and roles more tightly.

There are basically three end points for most co-founders dynamics:
 - Some co-founders may move to individual contributor roles and are
   happy there (Steve Wozniak at Apple).
 - A co-founders may remain as a key executive and help drive the
   success of the company as CTO, president, VP product, or another
   role.
 - One or more co-founders may leave if they feel they do not have
   enough influence at a company, if they want the CEO role and know
   they will not attain it in the short run, or if there is a mismatch
   between their skills and the role they want to play. Some may also
   leave due to family circumstances-a sick family member or needing to
   move for a spouse.

The change is co-founders status is driven either by 
(i) the need for there to be a single strategic direction and view point
driving a company as it scales or 
(ii) the co-founders getting out of their depths or competencies
relative to the scale of the company. As you grow employee headcount,
people need to know who to go to for final decisions or the company will
slow down and grind to a halt. You need to allocate resources to the
areas of greatest need and value. In parallel, your cofounder may or may
not have the skills and experience to play the role they want in the
future of the company..

To manage the co-founders transitions:
 - 1. Think through what roles your co-foudner would optimaly play for
      the next 12-18 months of the company.
      What functional role should the co-foudner play? What cultural
      role should thay play?
      What are ther ways you want them to be involved?(public speaking
      or events that fit their knowledge or that you do not attend?
      Certain  types of deals or partnerships?)
      And what input and decisions whould they play a role in what are
      the key types of topics you should be discussing with them
      ongoing)? Remember that this will be an ever-evolving story as the
      company scales, so you do not need to think too far ahead - 12 to
      18 months may be enough.
 
 - 2. Ask your co-founders to think through what they want to do. And
      have them write a job specification for themselves.
 - 3. Have a discussion.
    You and your cofounders need to resolve differences between what the
    cofounders want to do and what you as CEP think they should do. This
    will most likely be a series of conversations if ther is a mismatch.
 - 4. Enlist an advisor, investor, or board member you both trust to do
      the right thing for the discussion. If you ad your cofounder are
      unable to resolve the role change together you many need to enlist
      a third party for mediation and help.

 - 5. Once you reach agreement. What are the things you can do for your
      cofounder to help them succeed in this new role? Do they need a
      management coach?

Remember at all times that your cofounders took an early bet on the idea
or company just like you did, and that they are a major equity holder
(and potentially board member) of the company. While a lot of emotion is
tied up into co-founders relationships(like any long term partnerships),
it is critical to the success of your company that you find a solution.

If you and your co-founders are unable to reach agreement, you will
likely need to negotiate the exit of that co-founders from the company.
In some cases this may be contentious. Alternatively, your co-founders
may be relieved that the company has reached a level of growth and
success that allows her to leave without hurting momentum. If a
cofounder is not playing the CEO role, she may eventually feel
disempowered and want to go work on something where she is the final
decision maker.

### UNEQUAL COFOUNDERS
One of the big myths in Silicon Valley is that co-founders should be
equal. However if you look at the most successful tech startups of the
last 50 years, many of them had a dominant cofounder. This includes:
 Amazon. Jeff Bozos.
 Apple. Steve Jobs famously split equity unequally with Wozniak.
 Facebook. Although Zuck had multiple cofounders, the website used to be
 called "A Mark Zuckerberg production" and he had many times as much
 equity and power as his cofounders.
  Instagram. Kevin Systrom was the dominant founder.

Most of these companies are examples where both power and equity splits
between founders were unequal. In general equal power sharing yields
worse outcomes than having a dominant cofounder (or at least one who
emerges as dominant once a company starts working). Founding a company
is hard, and having a cofounder helps balance the work and stress of a
startup. The key is to have clear decision making so that a single
individual (the CEO) can set a clean path forward.

The set of counter examples with more equal cofounding partnerships
includes Google (cofounder by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with a bit of
a founder-like contribution by Eric Schmidt being hired as CEO early in
its life). Having an equal cofounding relationship is not impossible,
it's just rare among the most successful companies.
