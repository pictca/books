# Jeff Bezos Says to Build a Life You're Proud of, 
# Ask These 12 Questions.
- The Amazon CEO is known for offering sage advice--this may be his
deepest dose.
Jeff Bezos has mode enough mistakes and seen enough success that he's
qualified to offer advice of all kinds. Some of his most intriguing came
from a Prineton University commencement speech in 2010. The speech was
titled "We Are What We Choose" and distinguished between the gifts we
have and the choices we make.

Said Bezos: "When you're 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of
reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your
life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be
the series of choices you've made."

Valuable advice followed in the form of 12 questions Bezos asked his
audience to reflect upon deeply to help build a great life story. Here
they are, meashed with my own perspective.

## 1. How will you use your gifts?
We all have gifts, no exception. How can you wield yours like the
superpowers they are to do good for the world?

Different gifts can surface at different times. My business/marketing
gifts served me well for decades, until I wanted to use other gifts in
servitude(thus becoming a speaker/author/teacher/coach). I've found the
most happiness in using my gifts to serve something greater than myself.

## 2. What choices will you make?
This is about being intentional, working on your life versus in.
Breaking toxic patterns and accepting responsibility for the outcomes.
And as 70s rock icon Geddy Lee sang: "If you choose not to decide, you
still have made a choice," so living on autopilot isn't an option.
Choose to be intentional in your choices.

## 3. Will inertia be your guide, or will you follow your passions?
"Unstuck" starts with "U." The road to success is dotted with many
tempting parking spots-if you've put in park, thrust it into drive.

I fell into a comfortable, corporate pattern. Things were coming easy
but learning and growth wasn't. I was shrinking. It wasn't until I
kinked my entrepreneurial dreams into overdrive that I yanked myself out
of a rut.

## 4. Will you follow dogma or be original?
I haven't done everything right over my career as a boss. But I know
that when I gave employees the space, encouragement, and safety to bring
their original thinking to the table (and managed by objective versus
oversight), I saw wings unfurl.

Your will too, if you dare to create. It doesn't have to be something
that's absolutely unique, just uniquely you.

## 5. Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and
adventure?
Shifting to life of servitude wasn't easy. I had to redefine what
success looks like, rethink how much wealth/income I really needed,
reevaluate what living comfortably means. While the challenges that come
with a life of service/adventure aren't inconsequential, I can't imagine
it any other way at this stage of my life.

## 6. Will you with under criticism or follow your convictions?
You decide who gets to criticize you. Not all criticism is created equal
- some doing the criticizing shouldn't even get a seat at the table.

## 7. Will you bluff it out when you're wrong or apologize?
The fastest route to regret is to let your role in tension/conflict
linger. And I've never, ever regretted being the bigger person when
necessary.

## 8. Will you guard your heart against rejection or act when you fall
in love?
I know the temptation to be smarmy is high given Bezos' recent
indiscretions, but it shouldn't taint the truth to this point.

## 9. Will you play it safe or be a bit swashbuckling?
You know that pit you feel in your stomach before you try something that
scares/worries you? That feeling isn't there to frighten you. It's there
to tell you that something must be worth it, otherwise you'd feel
nothing.

## 10. When it's tough, will you give up or be relentless?
Psychology research from the University of Pennsylvania indicates that
mental toughness or "grit," as the researchers call it, is the single
most important factor for success, even above intelligence. Being
persistent pays.

## 11. Will you be a cynic or a builder?
Cynics lose their power when challenged. Challenge yourself to lift up
rather than tear down. There are so many trolls that hide under their
bridge and spew acid. Don't be a troll-be a bride.

## 12. Will you be clever at the expense of others, or will you be kind?
There's no value my wife and I try to role model more for our child than
kindness. Why? Because it's the positive, environment-molding attribute
from which all other positive attribute flow.

We're the editors of our own life story. Our job is to build the most
meaningful chapters we can before "The End". So get introspective now to
enjoy your looking-back perspective later.
